<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Dave Porter’s War Honors</span>” is a complete
story in itself, but forms the fifteenth volume
in a line issued under the general title, “Dave
Porter Series.”</p>

<p>As my old readers know, this line was begun
years ago by the publication of “Dave Porter at
Oak Hall,” in which I introduced a wide-awake
American boy at a typical American boarding-school.
This was followed by “Dave Porter in
the South Seas,” and then by “Dave Porter’s Return
to School.” After that we had “Dave Porter
in the Far North,” where the lad went on a
long journey looking for his father; “Dave Porter
and His Classmates,” in which the hero was
put to a most severe test; and then by “Dave Porter
at Star Ranch,” where a number of strenuous
adventures befell him.</p>

<p>Leaving the West, Dave returned again to
school, as related in “Dave Porter and His Rivals.”
Then came a remarkable voyage, as narrated
in “Dave Porter on Cave Island”; following
which he taught some of his school friends a
much-needed lesson, the particulars of which were
set forth in “Dave Porter and the Runaways.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>It was not long after this that we again found
our hero in the West, as related in “Dave Porter
in the Gold Fields,” where he helped to relocate
a lost mine. Coming back, he put in a grand
vacation in the Adirondack Mountains, many of
the particulars of which are told in “Dave Porter
at Bear Camp.”</p>

<p>Graduating from school, our hero took up the
study of civil engineering. This at first took
him to the Mexican Border, as related in “Dave
Porter and His Double,” and then out to Montana,
as we learn in “Dave Porter’s Great
Search.”</p>

<p>The great war in Europe was now on, and the
entrance of our country into the contest caused
Dave to become an army engineer. He went to
France and there had some decidedly strenuous
adventures, as told in “Dave Porter Under Fire.”</p>

<p>In the present volume Dave is still with the
“fighting engineers” on the war-scarred battle-fields
of France. His adventures are thrilling in
the extreme, but no more so than have fallen to
the lot of many a young American in this epoch-making
conflict.</p>

<p>Again I thank my many readers for the interest
they have shown in my books; and I trust that the
reading of the present volume will inspire all with
an added love for our country.</p>

<p class="ph2">DAVE PORTER’S WAR HONORS</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>NEAR THE FIGHTING FRONT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Phil</span>, where is Roger?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Dave. I haven’t seen him for
the last quarter of an hour.”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose he got lost somewhere in
that gully we crossed?” continued Dave Porter,
with an anxious look on his bronzed face.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be surprising, Dave,” answered
Phil Lawrence. “I almost got lost myself, the
tangle of underbrush was so thick.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and don’t forget that we had to hide once
or twice when the Boches sent over those big
shells,” broke in another member of the engineering
party, that was working its way through some
scrub timber not a great distance back of the
American fighting front in France.</p>

<p>“I’m not forgetting that,” answered Dave
grimly.</p>

<p>He well remembered how he had heard the
whining of a shell, had dropped down into a shell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
crater, and then heard the missile explode some
distance away. His left shin had been barked,
and likewise his shoulder, but to these small hurts
he was just then paying no attention.</p>

<p>“We might set up a call for him,” said another
of the army engineers, a rather stout individual.</p>

<p>“No, don’t do that, Buster!” cried Dave hastily.
“Some of those Boches may be closer than
we imagine. I heard a report from somebody
yesterday that they thought the Germans had some
machine-gun nests in the upper end of this wood.”</p>

<p>“Say, talking about machine-guns puts me in
mind of a story I heard last night,” broke in a
tall, lanky-appearing engineer. “Two men of a
gun company had a—”</p>

<p>“For the love of beans, Shadow! don’t start to
tell a story now,” broke in Phil Lawrence.
“Keep those for to-night, when we get back to
our shelter.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a very long story,” grumbled the
would-be story-teller. “However, it will keep,”
he added resignedly. “But say! it sure is funny
about Roger. The last I saw of him he was
crossing that gully about a hundred feet away
from where I was.”</p>

<p>“You saw him go down, I suppose, Shadow,”
remarked Dave. “But did you see him come
up?”</p>

<p>“I did not. I was busy looking out for myself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
I was afraid the minute I showed myself
some sharpshooter or machine-gun crowd would
fire on me.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad we couldn’t go forward and finish
that road we started,” said another of the
young engineers, Ben Basswood. “I don’t understand
it at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, orders are orders, Ben; and they must
be obeyed,” answered Dave, with a smile. He
was now a sergeant and in command of the detail
which was making its way through that section of
the wood on the American front.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know that!” responded Dave’s former
school chum quickly. “I suppose there must be
a good reason for stopping the work. By the
way, it looks to me as if a storm was coming up.”</p>

<p>“Gee! we’ve had nothing but storms lately,”
grumbled Phil Lawrence. “At least five in the
last two weeks! You’d think there wouldn’t be
any more water left in the sky.”</p>

<p>Over to the eastward a heavy mass of clouds
had appeared. There had been but little wind,
but now the leaves began to stir, and then a breeze
sprang up, while the heavens began to grow dark
rapidly. Far off to the north there had been a
constant booming of heavy artillery, punctuated
occasionally by the rattle of smaller firearms.
Now the booming of the cannon on the German,
front commenced to extend southward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>“Say, that sounds as if we might get in the
direct line of fire before long!” cried Phil.</p>

<p>“Perhaps that’s the reason we were ordered to
go back,” answered Dave. “Come, boys, we’ll
have to hurry a bit. Hike up.”</p>

<p>The young civil engineers were well loaded
down, not only with full soldier kits, including
guns, but also with various tools, including picks,
shovels and axes. Consequently, to “hike up”
over the uneven ground and through the scrub
timber and rank undergrowth was by no means
easy.</p>

<p>“This traveling sure does get a fellow’s wind,”
grumbled Buster, as he stopped for a moment to
catch his breath and run the perspiration from his
forehead with the side of his finger. “Talk
about exercise—this beats anything I ever did
in the Oak Hall gym.”</p>

<p>“Wow! wouldn’t old Oak Hall look good to us
now?” cried Shadow, his eyes shining. “Think
of that comfortable mess-hall, with those beautiful
tables all set with clean linen and chinaware, and
the smoking hot meat, not to say anything about
the mashed potatoes, green corn, lima beans, and
that beautiful pie, and—”</p>

<p>“Say! if you keep on talking that way, I’ll
drown you in the first shell-hole full of water we
come to!” burst out Phil. “I’m hungry enough
now without your making me worse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>“Never mind, boys, I guess there will be a good
hot mulligan waiting for us when we get to camp,”
said Dave, with a grin.</p>

<p>The detail of which Dave Porter was in command
consisted of twelve army engineers. The
majority of them were young men, four of whom
were Dave’s personal friends and old school
chums. All had been tramping through the wood
for the best part of an hour, trying to reach their
headquarters, located among some hills farther to
the southward.</p>

<p>“Say, Dave, did Roger tell you anything about
his gas mask?” questioned Phil, while the two
were walking side by side, with the others behind.</p>

<p>“He told me yesterday that he didn’t think it
was in very good working order,” was the reply.
“He said he wanted to have it fixed when he got
back to camp.”</p>

<p>“Well, he tried to fix it himself this morning,
and in doing it broke the mouthpiece.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he get it fixed at all?” questioned the
young sergeant of the engineer quickly.</p>

<p>“I don’t think he did. He didn’t have time.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad! He ought to have taken
time. It’s dangerous to be out in this neighborhood
without a mask that is in good working
order.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I told him. But he said he
guessed it would be all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>The young civil engineers now reached a portion
of the wood where the ground was very uneven
and interspersed with many jagged rocks.
Here, in some places, the shell-fire of a former
battle had thrown up the ground and the growth
in violent fashion, so that they were often at a
loss how to progress. Once Dave stepped into
some undergrowth and went down into a hole up
to his knees, and a moment later came a stifled
cry from Buster Beggs.</p>

<p>“Hello! there goes Buster!” cried Shadow.</p>

<p>“Where did he go?” questioned Dave, turning
around.</p>

<p>“Slid off through those bushes on the left.”</p>

<p>“Help me! Somebody pull me out, or I’ll
drown!” called the hapless engineer.</p>

<p>Working their way through the bushes, the others
saw Buster floundering around in a shell crater
which was about ten feet in diameter and of unknown
depth. It was almost filled with dirty
water, and in this the young engineer was struggling,
the load on his back dragging him downward.</p>

<p>Standing on the edge of the shell-hole, Dave
extended the stock of his gun, and Phil did likewise,
and, grasping both of these, Buster was
dragged to the edge of the hole, and then willing
hands assisted him once more to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>“What’s the matter, Buster? Didn’t you see
the hole?” questioned Dave.</p>

<p>“I did, when it was too late,” was the answer.
“The ground on that side is all wet and slippery,
and I went down on it like on a toboggan-slide.
Say! I’m some wet and muddy, eh?” and he
looked at himself dolefully.</p>

<p>“Never mind. You’ll not mind the storm
that is coming up,” remarked Dave. “Unless I
miss my guess, we’ll all be soaked to the skin in a
few minutes.”</p>

<p>To the rumble of the distant guns was now
added the rumble of thunder. Then came several
sharp flashes of lightning, and the wind came rushing
through the wood.</p>

<p>“It’s coming, all right enough!” cried Phil.</p>

<p>“Come! Hike up and follow me!” cried
Dave. “I think I know where we can get a little
shelter if it becomes too bad.”</p>

<p>Carrying their heavy packs and engineering implements
as best they could, the engineers hurried
along through the wood at Dave’s heels. The
young sergeant was headed for a small hill, to one
side of which was something of a cliff that he
thought might offer at least slight protection from
the on-coming storm. He had visited the cliff
some days before, and had noticed that there was
more or less of a hollow beneath it, a hollow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
screened by a number of trees and some dense
underbrush.</p>

<p>As they advanced, Dave could not but think of
his chum, Roger Morr.</p>

<p>“He should have kept close to us,” said Dave
to Ben. “There is no use in taking chances by
straying away in such a dangerous locality as
this.”</p>

<p>“Maybe Roger was hit by a stray bullet and
we never knew it,” was the reply. “You know
every once in a while some poor fellow is knocked
out that way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say that, Ben!” answered Dave,
and then he became exceedingly thoughtful.
Roger was engaged to Dave’s sister, and what
would Laura say if the young civil engineer
should be thus laid low?</p>

<p>The engineers came in sight of the cliff just as
the first big drops of the on-coming storm came
beating down on the leaves. Without hesitation,
Dave led the way through some heavy underbrush
until the foot of the cliff was gained.</p>

<p>“Well, this is some shelter, but not a great
deal,” remarked Shadow.</p>

<p>“Better than being out there in the open,”
returned Buster.</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken when there came a
vivid flash of lightning, followed by a deafening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
crash of thunder. Then came another crash not
a great distance away.</p>

<p>“Gee! that lightning struck a tree pretty close
to us!” gasped one of the engineers.</p>

<p>“There it is—right up on the top of the cliff!”
exclaimed Phil.</p>

<p>“Look out! It’s coming down!” announced
Dave. “Come in close to the rocks, all of you!”</p>

<p>The engineers did as directed, and a moment
later they heard the big tree rolling and crashing
through the underbrush some distance away.
Then came another crash of thunder, followed by
a tremendous downpour of rain.</p>

<p>Keeping close to the foot of the cliff, Dave and
the others of his party began to search around
among the rocks. Presently one of the young fellows
set up a shout.</p>

<p>“Here is an opening! I don’t know how deep
it is, but it looks to be pretty roomy.”</p>

<p>Dave carried a pocket flashlight with him, and
this was turned on to dispel the gloom, for the
sky was now completely overcast, and under the
cliff it was quite dark.</p>

<p>“It’s a regular cave,” announced the young
sergeant, after a hasty examination. “Here,
Phil, give me your hand and I will let myself
down and look around.”</p>

<p>The opening under the cliff proved to be amply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
large to shelter all of them, and the army engineers
were glad enough to get into it and relieve
themselves of their packs. Then they sat
down to rest and to talk over the situation.</p>

<p>“I’d feel a good deal better if Roger were
with us,” remarked Dave to Phil, as he and his
old school chum peered forth from the opening
of the cave-like shelter.</p>

<p>“You’ve said it, Dave!” was the low reply.
“Gee! if anything happened to Roger—” Phil
did not finish, but shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>“I’m going out to look for him just as soon as
the storm lets up.”</p>

<p>“You’ll let me go along, won’t you, Dave?”
questioned the other quickly. Phil himself was
only a corporal, so he must obey any order from
a superior.</p>

<p>“Of course,” was the ready response.</p>

<p>The engineers had emergency rations with
them, and they lost no time in satisfying their
hunger as best they could, building a small fire
for the purpose of making some hot chocolate
and drying out Buster’s water-soaked garments.</p>

<p>The rather scanty meal finished, Dave, followed
by Phil, crawled out of the shelter and
walked forward to where the base of the cliff
came to an end. Here they could still hear the
booming of the distant artillery.</p>

<p>“Looks to me as if the storm was letting up,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
remarked Phil. “And the wind is dying down,
too.”</p>

<p>To this remark Dave made no answer. He
was listening intently, and now to hear better he
placed his hand to his ear.</p>

<p>“What do you hear?” questioned Phil, after
a moment of silence.</p>

<p>“Listen for yourself, Phil.”</p>

<p>The other young engineer did so, and then a
look of alarm came into his face.</p>

<p>“Is that a gas attack warning, Dave?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what it is, Phil! The Germans
must be launching such an attack!”</p>

<p>“That’s bad!”</p>

<p>“Notify the others at once, Phil. Tell the
men I want them to take no chances, but get their
masks on and keep them on until they are dead
sure it is perfectly safe to take them off.”</p>

<p>“But what are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I’m going out to look for Roger. If he’s
lost in the woods, or if he’s been wounded and is
without a mask that will work, he’s in danger of
his life.”</p>

<p>“But you said I could go along!”</p>

<p>“All right, then, follow me. But warn all
the others first,” answered Dave; and then hurried
off through the rain-soaked wood on the
hunt for his missing chum.</p>

<small>THE GAS ATTACK</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I’ve</span> got to find Roger—I’ve <i>got</i> to do it!”</p>

<p>Such were the words that Dave murmured to
himself as he dashed away from Phil’s side, making
off in the direction where he had last seen
Roger Morr. As he advanced he adjusted his
gas mask, knowing that it would be foolhardy to
move along without it, even though it somewhat
impeded his breathing.</p>

<p>Dave was filled with a great fear for the welfare
of the lad who had been his chum for so
many years and who just before leaving home
had become engaged to his sister.</p>

<p>“If he’s all right, he’ll know how to make use
of his gas mask, even if the mouthpiece is broken,”
he reasoned to himself. “But if he’s badly
wounded, or is unconscious, he won’t be able to
save himself when the gas reaches him. Oh, I’ve
got to find him—I’ve just <i>got</i> to!”</p>

<p>To those of my readers who have perused one
or more of the former volumes in this series, Dave
Porter will need no introduction. For the benefit,
however, of those who are now meeting Dave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
for the first time, let me state a few facts concerning
his boyhood and the years immediately following.</p>

<p>When a very small lad Dave had been found
wandering alongside the railroad tracks in Crumville
in one of our eastern States. No one came
forward to claim him, and he was put in the local
poorhouse and later on bound out to a one-time
college professor, Caspar Potts, who was then
farming for his health.</p>

<p>In a fine mansion on the outskirts of Crumville
dwelt Mr. Oliver Wadsworth, a wealthy jewelry
manufacturer, with his wife and his daughter
Jessie. One day the gasoline tank of an automobile
took fire, and little Jessie was in danger of
being burned to death when Dave, who chanced
to be near, rushed to her rescue. Because of this
brave act, the rich jewelry manufacturer became
interested in the boy and decided that he should
be given the benefit of a good education.</p>

<p>The lad was sent to a first-class boarding-school,
as related in the first volume of this series, entitled,
“Dave Porter at Oak Hall.” With Dave went
Ben Basswood, his one friend in the town.</p>

<p>At Oak Hall, Dave made a host of friends, including
Roger Morr, the son of a well-known
United States senator; Phil Lawrence, whose
father was a rich shipowner; Maurice Hamilton,
who loved to tell stories and who was generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
known as “Shadow” because of his thinness: and
Buster Beggs, who was as stout as he was good-natured.</p>

<p>It can be easily understood that in those days
the principal thing that troubled Dave was the
question of his parentage. Some mean schoolboys
called him a “poorhouse nobody”; and to
solve the mystery of his identity he took a long
voyage, as related in “Dave Porter in the South
Seas.” He met his uncle, Dunston Porter, and
learned much concerning his father, David Breslow
Porter, and also his sister Laura, who were at
that time traveling in Europe.</p>

<p>After his trip to the South Seas, Dave returned
for a while to school, but then went to the Far
North and succeeded in locating his father.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Dave’s sister had gone to the
West, to visit her intimate friend, Belle Endicott,
who lived on Star Ranch in Montana. Later
still, Laura, Dave and some of his chums visited
the ranch and there had “the time of their lives,”
as they afterward declared.</p>

<p>Coming back from the West, Dave supposed
that matters would flow along smoothly, but such
was not the case. At Christmas time came a
startling robbery of the Wadsworth jewelry
works, and Dave and his chums discovered that
the crime had been committed by two of the
former bullies of Oak Hall. After a voyage to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Cave Island one of the rascals was captured and
the stolen goods recovered.</p>

<p>The trip to Cave Island was later on followed
by another to the great West, where Dave aided
Roger Morr in relocating a gold mine which had
been inherited by Mrs. Morr and lost through a
landslide.</p>

<p>After this our hero went to Bear Camp in the
Adirondack Mountains. There he had a most
unusual experience, falling in with a young man
who was almost his double in appearance.</p>

<p>Dave had now graduated from Oak Hall, and
he and Roger Morr had taken up the profession
of civil engineering. This work at first took them
to Texas, and then to the wilds of Montana.
They had positions with the Mentor Construction
Company, and their camp was under the general
management of Mr. Ralph Obray, assisted by a
number of others, including a middle-aged engineer,
Frank Andrews, who speedily became a
warm friend of the youths.</p>

<p>It was a great day for the young civil engineers
when they set sail for Central America to assist in
the work of building a railroad in Costa Rica.
This was at the time when the World War was in
progress in Europe, but before the United States
had entered the conflict. They were in the midst
of some exciting happenings in the Central American
republic when word came that the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
States had joined with the Allies “to make the
world safe for democracy.”</p>

<p>“Roger, how would you like to become an army
engineer?” Dave had asked of his chum. And
then he had spoken of how the United States
Government would probably need hundreds of
army engineers to assist the soldiers in their battles
with the Central Powers.</p>

<p>Mr. Ralph Obray had once been a major in the
State militia, and on returning to the United States
he became a captain of a unit of the engineers
raised by the Engineering Society. He was very
anxious to have Dave and Roger join this unit,
and after consulting with their folks, the two
young civil engineers were sworn into the service.
With them went Ben Basswood, and also Phil
Lawrence, Shadow Hamilton, and Buster Beggs.</p>

<p>Before the boys left home to go to Camp
Hickory, as the cantonment was called, several
interesting events took place. As my old readers
know, to Dave there was no girl in the world quite
so nice as Jessie Wadsworth, and the pair had a
very definite understanding regarding what they
intended to do when Dave returned from the war.</p>

<p>Roger had always been very attentive to Laura
Porter, and just before leaving for camp their
engagement was announced.</p>

<p>On his first trip to Star Ranch, Phil Lawrence
had become enamored of Belle Endicott, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
happiness of his chums made him exceedingly
anxious regarding his own future. He sent an
earnest telegram to Belle; and a little later met
that young lady in New York City and there got
her to promise something which was in every degree
highly satisfactory to the shipowner’s son.</p>

<p>From Camp Hickory the young civil engineers
entrained for an American port, and there went
aboard one of the big army transports, as related
in the last volume of this series, entitled, “Dave
Porter Under Fire.”</p>

<p>This transport was attacked by two submarines,
but escaped injury, and a little later the young
soldiers found themselves on French soil. Here
they went into intensive training for a number of
weeks and were then sent to the front.</p>

<p>While in the training camp at home Dave and
the others had made the acquaintance of a French
widow, who had suffered much because of the war
and because of the doings of a German spy, named
Rudolph Holtzmann. The poor widow’s two
children had been lost during the first upheaval of
war in Alsace-Lorraine, and to add to her misery
she was later on robbed by the spy, who had been
boarding with her.</p>

<p>All the “fighting engineers,” as they were affectionately
termed, had had some strenuous adventures
during those first few weeks on the firing
line. They had been set to building roadways<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
and bridges, and had been under fire on more than
one occasion. Then, during a brief respite in
their work, Dave had gotten word concerning
Rudolph Holtzmann, and, with the aid of the
French authorities, had succeeded in cornering
this rascal and had discovered the whereabouts of
the Widow Carot’s missing children.</p>

<p>Dave, Roger, and Phil had been cited in the orders
of the day for bravery, and a little later Dave
had been made a sergeant of the engineers, while
Roger and Phil became corporals.</p>

<p>“You’re getting up in the world, Dave,” had
been Roger’s comment. “First thing you know,
you’ll be a lieutenant or a captain.”</p>

<p>“Time enough for that, Roger,” Dave answered.
“I think you’ve got just as good a
chance as I have. In fact, I can’t understand
why they didn’t make you and Phil sergeants as
well as myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we didn’t do as much as you did,” the
senator’s son had answered. “You always were
a natural-born leader.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it, Roger!” Dave had cried. Nevertheless,
he knew that his chum was sincere in what
he said, and he was correspondingly pleased. At
heart Roger was one of the best fellows in the
world, and it was with intense satisfaction that
Dave had learned the young man was one day to
become his only sister’s husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>And that was the reason why, as he dashed
through the rain-soaked wood, Dave told himself
that he must find Roger, no matter at what cost.
He felt that if he failed in this his sister would
never forgive him, and, for the matter of that, he
would never forgive himself.</p>

<p>He ploughed forward through the soaked underbrush
and scrambled over the rough rocks as
best he could. Then, as looking through the
mask was difficult, he took a deep breath, and,
holding it, took the mask off for a moment to
gaze around him anxiously. But no human being
was in sight, and, readjusting his mask, he went
forward once again. Glancing backward, he saw
that Phil was swiftly following him.</p>

<p>Off to the north of where he had been walking
there had been at one time something of a woods’
trail, used probably by the farmers of that vicinity.
This was much torn up, with shell craters
dotting it at short distances. As Dave came
closer to this abandoned trail he caught sight of
something which caused him to stop in wonder.
There, sheltered by some rocks and a mass of
brushwood, were a heap of unused shells, evidently
for three-inch guns.</p>

<p>“How in the world did those shells get here?”
he asked himself. “They certainly don’t belong
to our artillery.”</p>

<p>A brief examination revealed to the young engineer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
that they were German shells. They had
probably been left there by the Huns at the time
they had tried to take the wood several weeks
before. A slight advance had been made by one
or two German regiments, but this had been repulsed
by the American artillery.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to report this to headquarters as soon
as I get back,” he told himself.</p>

<p>He was just turning away from the pile of
shells when Phil came up. He pointed the pile
out to his chum, and the young corporal was much
surprised. He motioned to the shells and then
toward the American line, but Dave shook his
head and pointed toward the German line, to indicate
that they must be shells left there by the
enemy.</p>

<p>So far there was but a slight trace of gas
throughout the wood, but as the two young civil
engineers advanced they met a cloud of the poisonous
vapor rolling toward them in a yellowish haze.
Dave felt of his mask to make sure that it was
properly adjusted and pointed to Phil’s, who nodded
to show that he also was on his guard.</p>

<p>Presently the pair reached the spot where Roger
had last been seen by them. They looked around
in every direction, but without avail. Then Dave
looked at his chum, but Phil merely shrugged his
shoulders to show that he did not know what to
make of the situation or what to do next.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>THE FINDING OF ROGER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As the</span> two young army engineers turned away
from where they were standing to look up and
down the gully which had been crossed at the time
they had seen the last of their chum, they noticed
that the cloud of poisonous gas was growing more
dense. On every side the water-laden wood
showed a thick and sickly yellow haze, the very
appearance of which was enough to make one
shudder.</p>

<p>For the time being the rain had let up. Overhead
the heavy clouds were passing swiftly to the
southward, but the wind seemed to be too high
up to drive the poisonous gas away.</p>

<p>Dave and his chum traveled all of a quarter of
a mile down the gully without getting any trace
of Roger. Then they came back on the far side
of the gully and progressed in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>This upper section of the wood had been under
fire several times during the war, and was consequently
much torn up. Shell-holes were to be met
at every little distance, and here and there the
dying trees lay across the underbrush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>Presently Dave clutched his chum by the arm
and pointed to an opening leading down into the
gully at a point which so far had not been explored.
There on the ground lay a newspaper—a
copy of the <i>Stars and Stripes</i>, the official sheet
of the American Expeditionary Force in France.
Both of the young civil engineers were much interested
in the discovery of this newspaper, for
they remembered that Roger had had a copy of
the publication with him on their last trip forward.
In fact, the senator’s son had read some articles
aloud for the benefit of his friends.</p>

<p>“If this is the newspaper he was carrying, he
must have come this way,” was Dave’s reasoning,
and Phil was of a similar mind.</p>

<p>With caution, for the going was treacherous,
the two young engineers made their way down the
rocks and over the muddy places and through the
rain-soaked underbrush toward the bottom of the
gully, which, at this point, was thirty or forty feet
in depth and probably twice that in width at the
top. At the bottom was a tiny watercourse, gurgling
over and around the jagged rocks.</p>

<p>Reaching the watercourse, Dave and Phil
looked up and down for some trace of their missing
chum. But on account of the poisonous haze,
which filled the gully, it was difficult to see any
considerable distance.</p>

<p>Dave motioned to his chum that he was going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
farther up the gully, and Phil nodded to show that
he was willing to continue the search, even though
the poisonous gas in that hollow might be highly
dangerous for both of them.</p>

<p>They had progressed less than a hundred feet
when, on coming to a momentary halt, they suddenly
found several small stones rolling toward
them from one side of the gully. Looking up in
that direction, they discovered Roger seated on a
rock and motioning to them.</p>

<p>The lost young engineer had his gas mask adjusted,
for which both Dave and Phil were thankful.
But he sat on the rock nursing his left ankle,
and now they saw that he had removed his shoe
and had the ankle bound with a bandage.</p>

<p>By looking up behind Roger it was easy to make
out what had happened to him. In trying to make
his way out of the gully after coming down from
the other side, he had trusted his weight to some
bushes near the top. They had given way, and
he had come down almost to the bottom with a
rush, falling and rolling over some sharp rocks as
he did so. Then he showed them how his left
foot had become caught between two of the rocks,
and this had twisted his ankle, making it so painful
that he could not use the foot.</p>

<p>Dave felt that the first thing for him and Phil
to do was to get Roger out of the gas-choked
gully. The young engineers had had not a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
experience in carrying wounded men, and now this
helped them to lift Roger and move him without
causing the hurt ankle much additional pain.
They did not attempt to get to the top of the gully
at that point, but walked along the watercourse
for several hundred feet, until they reached a
point where egress from the hollow was comparatively
easy. On the upper level all were glad to
notice that the gas was considerably thinner.
Here the breeze was beginning to freshen, and
this was serving to dissipate the noxious chemicals.
But even though the gas was becoming thinner and
thinner, the young engineers knew better than to
remove their masks too quickly.</p>

<p>Having reached the top of the gully, Dave decided
to set off in the direction of the cliff where
he had left the others of his detail. In order to
make certain of the direction he pulled out a
pocket compass for consultation. Then, more
out of habit than because he wanted to know the
time, he looked for his watch.</p>

<p>The timepiece was gone! It had disappeared
along with the strap that had held it.</p>

<p>Dave was startled, and not without good reason,
for the wrist-watch was one that had been
presented to him on leaving for the front and was
both handsome and valuable.</p>

<p>Like a flash it suddenly came to the young engineer
where the watch had been dropped. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
remembered now that he had looked at it when
about to turn away from the pile of German shells
which he had found hidden near the old wood
trail. After looking at the watch he now remembered
that something had struck his foot, which
at the time he had thought was a stick or a stone.
Now he felt sure it must have been the missing
timepiece.</p>

<p>It would not be much out of their way to return
to the vicinity of the cliff by way of the spot where
the pile of shells had been discovered, and so
Dave and Phil set off in that direction carrying
Roger between them. The wind was now coming
up strongly; and soon they felt it would be safe
to remove their gas masks, and accordingly did so.</p>

<p>“Gosh! but I’m glad to get this off,” were
Phil’s first words, after he had cautiously tested
the air with his nose to discover if he could still
detect the odor of gas.</p>

<p>Even though the mouthpiece on his mask had
been broken, Roger had had little difficulty in using
the outfit, and had not suffered from the poisonous
attack. But his left ankle pained him not a
little, and when, supported by his chums, he attempted
to stand on his foot he made a decidedly
wry face.</p>

<p>“Ouch!” he exclaimed. “Feels worse than
ten thousand needles jabbing through it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” answered Dave kindly. “We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
can carry you just as well as not, can’t we, Phil?”</p>

<p>“Of course we can!” was the quick reply. “It
will take us a little longer to reach the others, but
what of that?”</p>

<p>“Dave, I hope you get your watch back. I
know you’d hate to lose it,” said Roger, as the
others prepared to pick him up once more.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m almost certain I know where I
dropped it,” was the young sergeant’s reply.</p>

<p>The booming of the heavy artillery in the distance
had ceased, but now came another crash off
to the southward.</p>

<p>“That’s thunder!” exclaimed Phil. “Looks
to me as if that storm might be coming back.”</p>

<p>“It certainly did let down while it was at it,”
remarked Roger. “I didn’t have to crawl down
to the brook to soak that bandage for my ankle.
All I had to do was to draw it over the bushes and
grass around me and it got soaked in a minute.”</p>

<p>The veering of the wind once again made the
atmosphere pure around them, and for this, as they
drank in the fresh air, they were exceedingly
thankful.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you one thing—fresh air is like fresh
water,” remarked Phil. “You don’t know how
good both of them are until you can’t get them.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you I felt pretty bad down there in
the gully all alone,” returned Roger. “Once or
twice I tried to crawl out, but the pain in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
ankle was so terrific it was too much for me. I
was afraid that I might faint, and then if my mask
got loose in any way it would have been all up with
me.”</p>

<p>As they advanced Dave told of finding the pile
of three-inch shells hidden in the brushwood.
Roger was as much interested as Phil had been.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they were put there lately,
Dave?” questioned the corporal.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so, Roger. I think they date
back to some other time—probably some time before
we were on or near this front. You know
this part of France had been under fire for many
months.”</p>

<p>The sky was growing dark again, and now came
a flash of lightning at a distance, followed by a
rumble of thunder. Then came more rain and
several other lightning flashes, each one a little
nearer than those before.</p>

<p>“We’re in for it, all right enough,” was Phil’s
comment. “I wish we were back in the shelter
of the cliff.”</p>

<p>“How far is that from here?” questioned
Roger.</p>

<p>“At least a quarter of a mile,” answered Dave.</p>

<p>With the storm coming on again the wood grew
rapidly darker, so that it was with difficulty that
the young engineers picked their way through the
tangle of brushwood and around the rocks and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
fallen trees. It was now raining steadily, and
before long all were wet to the skin.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad I took you so far out of the way,
Phil,” remarked Dave. “I suppose we might
have gone on direct to the shelter of the cliff, and
I could have come back to look for that watch
some time later.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right, Dave,” was the quick
reply. “We would have got wet anyhow. I
want you to get your watch back first of all. It
won’t do the timepiece any good to be lying out
there in the wet.”</p>

<p>The three young engineers were still about a
hundred yards away from the hidden shells when
the storm seemed to burst directly over their heads
with tremendous fury. There was a vivid flash
of lightning, followed by a loud crack of thunder,
and then off to their left they heard one of the big
trees of the forest come down with a crash, carrying
some small growth with it.</p>

<p>“Wow! that was some crack, believe me!” exclaimed
Phil, after it was over.</p>

<p>“We can be mighty thankful we weren’t under
that tree that was struck,” said Roger.</p>

<p>“It certainly is a heavy storm,” put in Dave;
“and it seems to be growing worse every minute.
Just look how dark it is becoming.”</p>

<p>“I hope it doesn’t get so dark you can’t see to
find your watch,” said Phil.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>The lightning and thunder had brought them to
a temporary halt, but now they started to go forward
again, the flash of lightning having left them
in a darkness which was almost absolute.</p>

<p>“Be careful you don’t go down in some hole,
Dave,” cried Phil, for the young sergeant was in
advance, carrying Roger by the knees, while Phil
in the rear supported their chum under his arms.</p>

<p>The words had scarcely been spoken when there
came another jagged flash of lightning from the
sky almost directly, so it seemed, in front of the
young engineers. They saw the fork of electricity
shoot down into the very midst of the spot where
the German shells lay hidden. The flash of
lightning was followed by a crack of thunder, and
then almost immediately afterward came a tremendous
explosion from the pile of shells as a
number of them seemed to go off simultaneously.</p>

<p>There was an awful flash of fire, and then Dave
and the others were hurled backward in a heap
among the bushes and trees.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>LETTERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> fully a minute after the tremendous explosion
there was silence, broken only by the falling
rain. Then came two minor explosions, one directly
after the other.</p>

<p>The three young engineers had been hurled into
a thick mass of brushwood, backed up by several
saplings. The brushwood had fortunately acted
as a sort of cushion for their bodies, otherwise one
or more of them must have been seriously injured.
Even as it was, Dave had the wind taken out of
him and had his left ear scratched by a branch.</p>

<p>When our hero managed to scramble to his feet
following the third explosion, he saw that Phil
was wedged in between two of the saplings.
Roger lay face downward, with both hands up to
protect his head.</p>

<p>“How is it, boys, either of you hurt?” demanded
the young sergeant, as soon as he could
speak.</p>

<p>“I—I—don’t exactly kn—know,” stammered
Phil slowly. “Any m—more explosions
coming?” he continued apprehensively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“I’m sure I don’t know.” Dave gazed at
Roger, who was now turning over and sitting up.
“How about you?”</p>

<p>“It didn’t do my hurt ankle much good,” responded
the senator’s son. “But I guess we can
all be thankful we weren’t blown to bits.”</p>

<p>“Or struck by the lightning,” added Dave.
“And either of those things might have happened
had we been where I think I dropped the watch.”</p>

<p>All three had by this time scrambled to their
feet out of the brushwood, and now they lost no
time in hurrying from the scene, Roger resting
an arm over the shoulder of each of his chums
and hopping along on his good foot. And it was
well that they did this, for presently came another
loud explosion, followed by several others.</p>

<p>“We got out just in time,” observed Phil, with
a grave shake of his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand what made those last shells
go off,” remarked Dave. “Certainly that lightning
couldn’t have done it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the dumps are connected with some
mine,” put in Roger quickly. “I wouldn’t put it
past the Germans to play some trick like that.
It’s been done before.”</p>

<p>He referred to an incident which had come to
light just about the time the American Expeditionary
Force had arrived in that neighborhood.
Some German shells had been found located in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
spot near a roadway. When the newly-arrived
soldiers had started to pick some of the shells up
they had disturbed some wires connected with a
mine and there had been a loud explosion in the
roadway. Fortunately, at that time no artillery
or motor-lorries were passing that particular spot,
so that comparatively small damage had been
done.</p>

<p>“Maybe the mine was located on that old wood
trail we saw,” said Phil. “They might have figured
out that the Americans would use that trail
in coming this way.”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s good-bye to that watch,” remarked
Dave. “If it was anywhere near the ammunition
dump those explosions must have smashed it completely.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know about that,” answered Phil.
“It may have fallen down in some hole or between
some rocks and been well protected. Just
the same, I don’t think I would go near the place
yet. There may be more explosions to come.”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to go near it,” answered Dave.
“We’ll get back to the cliff and see what the other
fellows are doing. If they are still there, these
explosions will make them wonder what is happening.”</p>

<p>But even though he spoke thus lightly, the
young sergeant felt the loss of the fine wrist-watch
keenly. As said before, it had been a present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
from the folks at home, and was quite valuable.</p>

<p>“I should have been more careful about it,” he
told himself rather bitterly. “I certainly was
careless.”</p>

<p>The lightning and thunder now seemed to shift
to the westward, but the rain continued to come
down almost as heavily as before. Roger hopped
along for quite a distance, but then intimated that
he would have to rest.</p>

<p>“We’ll carry you as we did before, Roger,”
said Dave. “It isn’t very far to the cliff from
here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why I had to have such rotten
luck trying to cross the gully,” remarked the injured
one dolefully. “I suppose this will send
me to the hospital for a few days at least, and I
don’t want to go. I want to be in the thick of
what is doing.”</p>

<p>“I think we’ll all have to rest up a bit, Roger,
if this storm keeps on,” announced Dave. “The
fact is, I don’t think the plans for the next advance
are quite worked out yet,” he continued.</p>

<p>Presently the three came in sight of the cliff,
and a few minutes later were down in the hollow
where Dave and Phil had left the others. A
shout went up from Ben and Shadow at their appearance.</p>

<p>“Hello! so you found him, did you?” cried
Shadow. “That’s fine!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“What’s the matter with your foot, Roger?”
demanded Ben.</p>

<p>“Oh, I twisted my ankle a bit between the
rocks.”</p>

<p>“Say, there have been some fearful explosions
following some flashes of lightning,” said one of
the other engineers. “Do you know anything
about them?”</p>

<p>“We know all about them,” answered Dave.
“We were close to them—in fact, too close for
comfort.” And in a few brief words those who
had come in told of what had occurred since Dave
and Phil had gone on the search for their missing
comrade.</p>

<p>“Lost your watch, eh, Dave?” said Ben.
“That’s too bad! But maybe you’ll be able to
find it after this storm clears away and when you
are sure there won’t be any more explosions at
that dump.”</p>

<p>All those left in the shelter of the cliff had
donned their gas masks when told to do so by Phil.
But Buster’s mask had not worked very well, and
now the stout lad lay on a pile of brushwood
looking anything but well.</p>

<p>“I guess I swallowed some of the gas, all right
enough,” he said in a somewhat choked voice,
while his eyes ran with tears. “You see, I
couldn’t breathe very well, and so I tried to fix it.
But I guess I made it worse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“If you got it, Buster, I guess the best thing
we can do is to get you to the hospital as soon as
possible,” said Dave quickly. And then he detailed
Ben and Shadow for that work.</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour the heavy rain ceased,
and the entire party set off for camp through a
misty drizzle, which was anything but cheering.
Those who had taken charge of Buster set off in
advance, supporting the heavy young engineer between
them. They were followed by the others,
all taking turns in carrying Roger.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that ankle is sprained so very
badly after all,” announced the senator’s son.
“And I am not going to the hospital unless I have
to. I can bathe it and wrap it up in liniment, and
maybe it will be all right in the morning.”</p>

<p>“And if it isn’t, Roger, I’ll see to it that you
get a day’s rest,” answered Dave.</p>

<p>On arriving at the engineers’ camp, Dave made
his report. Buster’s condition was immediately
investigated, and then an ambulance was called,
into which he was placed and carried to the nearest
emergency hospital.</p>

<p>“The poor fellow may be worse off than we
imagine,” said Captain Obray to Dave. “You
remember the fate of poor Williamson?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do,” answered our hero. Williamson
was a somewhat elderly engineer, hailing from
the South. Only a few weeks before he had gone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
to the front without his gas mask. As soon as
a gas attack came, Williamson had fled to the rear,
hoping to escape the deadly fumes. For several
days he had acted as if nothing had harmed him.
But then he had suddenly been taken with cramps
and a feeling of sickness all over, and he was now
in the hospital hovering between life and death.</p>

<p>Once back in camp, Roger lost no time in attending
to his injured ankle, being assisted in this
by Ben and Shadow. In the meantime Dave had
to attend to his duties as a sergeant, while Phil
went over to perform his own duties as a corporal,
and also those which had been assigned to the
senator’s son.</p>

<p>For three days it rained almost constantly—so
much so that it was next to impossible for the
engineers to do any of the work which had been
assigned to them. A large part of that territory
in France was rather low, and the rain caused
many pools and some lakes to form. One of the
main roadways was about a foot under water, and
many of the lorry drivers asked jokingly how soon
they were going to run boats in that vicinity. It
was almost impossible to move anything, and one
battery which attempted to shift its position got
completely stuck in the mud and had to be left
there until the storm let up.</p>

<p>In those days the young engineers had one place
to visit which gave them a great deal of comfort.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
This was a large Y. M. C. A. hut, which had been
established in that vicinity only a short while
before. Here the boys often gathered in their
off time, to write letters, play games, or listen to
the music of a small but sweet-toned phonograph
which had been set up. Those who cared to do
so could smoke, and also obtain chocolate and
other sweets, and likewise something hot to drink.</p>

<p>“It’s a mighty fine idea,” was Dave’s comment
one evening, after he had spent two hours at the
hut, writing some letters and listening to some
familiar songs reproduced on the phonograph.</p>

<p>“Right you are! And the Y. M. C. A. people
and those who are supporting the movement deserve
a great deal of credit for what they have
done,” replied Phil.</p>

<p>“I understand the Knights of Columbus are
going to put up a hut some miles farther down the
line,” put in another of the engineers.</p>

<p>“Yes. And the Salvation Army are doing
something of the same thing,” came from still another.
“A fellow was telling me the other day
that they were dealing out hot pies and doughnuts
right close to the firing-line. Some work for the
lassies, eh?” and he smiled broadly.</p>

<p>During those days Roger’s ankle grew better
rapidly. He still limped a little when he walked,
but he could get around, and declared that in a
few days more he would be as well as ever. Concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Buster, however, the report was not so
encouraging. Evidently he had got more of a
dose of the poisonous gas than he had thought,
and he was suffering considerably.</p>

<p>“It ought to be a lesson to all of us to be very
careful to keep our masks in perfect order,” said
Dave.</p>

<p>“It’s a lesson to me, all right enough,” answered
Roger. “My mask is in the best condition
now, and you can bet I’m going to see to it
that it is kept that way. I’d rather have a good
gas mask in this war than a good suit of clothes or
new shoes.”</p>

<p>“Letters! Letters! Letters!”</p>

<p>It was a welcome cry from the far end of the
camp, and immediately afterward came a rush
from all sides, every engineer being more than
anxious to get tidings from the loved ones left behind.
There was a good-natured scramble as a
whole sackful of epistles were distributed, and
then the men drifted off in one direction or another
to read the precious communications.</p>

<p>Dave was much disappointed. There was a
letter from his Uncle Dunston, but none from Jessie.
He had heard from the girl two weeks before,
but he had hoped that she would send another
communication soon. He saw that Roger
had a letter from his sister Laura, and knew that
between Laura’s letter and that from his uncle he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
would get a good idea of what was taking place in
Crumville. Phil had been made happy by two
letters; one, which evidently had been delayed,
being from Belle Endicott.</p>

<p>The letter from his Uncle Dunston contained
several items which were of considerable interest
to our hero. One was to the effect that the Wensell
Munition Company, in which Dave’s father
was greatly interested, was doing more war work
than ever before. And another was that both his
father and his uncle had been active in the new
Liberty Loan campaign, and had taken a large
block of the bonds and had induced Mr. Wadsworth
to do likewise.</p>

<p>“I knew they would do it,” said Dave to himself.
“They are true blue, every one of them.
My! from what Uncle Dunston writes, that Liberty
Loan campaign must have been a red-hot
one.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Of course we are all very proud of the fact
that you have become a sergeant,” wrote Dunston
Porter. “If you keep on the way you have
started some day you may become a lieutenant or
a captain, or go even higher. You certainly have
our best wishes.</p>

<p>“And that puts me in mind, Dave. You, of
course, remember Nat Poole, old Aaron Poole’s
son, with whom you had so many differences in the
past. Well, that slacker was finally drafted into
the army in spite of all old Poole could do to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
him out. They sent him off to Camp Hickory;
and now I understand he is on his way to France.
I hope the war will knock some of the conceit out
of him.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Nat Poole coming to France after all!” Dave
murmured to himself as he read this portion of the
letter. “I don’t see how they expect to make a
soldier of him.” He well remembered what a
coward Nat Poole had been and how even at Oak
Hall he had often tried to shield himself by getting
behind his cronies.</p>

<p>And then for the time being Dave dismissed
Nat Poole from his mind, never for a moment
dreaming of what trouble the coming of this fellow
to France portended.</p>

<small>NEWS FROM HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Immediately</span> after receiving his letter from
Laura, Roger had been called away to perform
some duties as a corporal, consequently it was
not until some time later that Dave met him
again. In the meantime the young sergeant ran
across Phil, who was all smiles.</p>

<p>“Everything is going along beautifully with
the Endicotts,” announced the shipowner’s son.
“Belle is deep in Red Cross work, and has promised
to send me a fine sweater she is making for
the coming winter. Her mother is in the work,
too. Mr. Endicott, of course, has his hands full
with railroad matters, for the road is shipping
large quantities of provisions and war materials,
as well as many soldiers. He says they are also
raising an extra large amount of cattle on Star
Ranch, because the packing-houses want all they
can get.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear everything is going along so
swimmingly,” announced Dave.</p>

<p>“Did you get a letter from Jessie?”</p>

<p>“I did not—worse luck! But I got a letter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
from my Uncle Dunston, and he says they are all
well with the exception of poor old Professor
Potts, who seems to be growing quite feeble. He
wrote about Nat Poole, who was drafted, and he
says Nat is now on the way to France.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say, Dave! That certainly is
news. How angry old Aaron Poole must have
been when they drafted Nat!”</p>

<p>“I suppose that is so, Phil. But I don’t believe
Mrs. Poole was angry. If you’ll remember,
she was quite a patriotic woman, and insisted on
doing a lot for the Red Cross in spite of her husband’s
objections.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember that. Probably she is proud
to know her son is in the army. I’d like to know
how Nat takes it.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know. I don’t believe he
would dare to grumble. The other fellows would
jump on him pretty quick.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps joining the army will make a man of
him.”</p>

<p>“I hope so.” Dave shook his head dolefully.
“Nat certainly was a slacker. He didn’t believe
in fighting, no matter what the provocation.”</p>

<p>“If he comes to France perhaps we’ll see him,
Dave.”</p>

<p>“It’s possible, but not very probable, Phil—with
so many hundreds of thousands coming over.
He may not come to this part of the country at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
all. You know they are sending some of our
men up into Belgium, and others down into Italy,
as well as over here.”</p>

<p>“Did your uncle have anything to say about
the Widow Carot and her children, or that rascally
spy, Rudolph Holtzmann?”</p>

<p>“He said that the widow was overjoyed at the
recovery of her children, and they were greatly
pleased to think that Holtzmann was going to get
what was coming to him from the French Government.
Of course, our claim against Holtzmann
has not yet been settled; but I think that
sooner or later we’ll get that money through the
French courts.”</p>

<p>A little later Roger came back, and Dave and
some of his other chums noticed that he looked unusually
thoughtful. Dave at once mentioned the
letter from his Uncle Dunston and told what it
contained.</p>

<p>“You got some letters too, didn’t you,
Roger?” he remarked after he had finished telling
his news and when there had come something
of an awkward pause.</p>

<p>“Yes, I got two; one from my mother and the
other from Laura. My mother says that she and
father are well and that father is very deep in
affairs at Washington. These are certainly mighty
busy times for a United States senator.” Roger
paused and Dave waited for him to go on. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
was quite usual for the chums to mention what
their letters contained, and often one or another
would read a portion of an epistle which he
thought might prove especially interesting.</p>

<p>“Laura also said they were all well at Crumville
except Professor Potts, who is beginning to show
his age,” went on the senator’s son. “She wrote
me quite a lot about some entertainments they had
been getting up for the benefit of some local charities
which have been suffering because of the Red
Cross and the Y. M. C. A. activities. I suppose
a good many folks think because they give so much
to the war organizations, they can’t afford to give
much for local charities, although local charities
have to be kept up just the same.”</p>

<p>And then Roger began to talk about charities
in general and from that branched off to other subjects,
including the war and the probable movements
of the engineers. It was evident to Dave
and Phil that he was holding something back, but
what it was neither of them could imagine. Dave
hoped with all his heart that no quarrel had arisen
between his sister and the chum he loved so well.</p>

<p>“Roger has got something on his mind—that’s
sure,” remarked Phil a little later, when he
and Dave were by themselves.</p>

<p>“So it looks to me, Phil. I hope neither of his
letters contained bad news.”</p>

<p>“If it was anything ordinary I think he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
tell us about it,” continued the shipowner’s son
thoughtfully. “It almost looks to me as if it
might concern us as well as Roger.”</p>

<p>“Well, if he doesn’t want to mention it, Phil, I
certainly am not going to ask him about it.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not—it wouldn’t be fair. He has
a right to keep it a secret if he wants to.”</p>

<p>All through the evening, when the young engineers
took themselves once again to the Y. M.
C. A. hut, where a well-known vaudeville singer
gave a short entertainment which was highly appreciated,
Dave and Phil, as well as some of the
others, noticed how preoccupied in mind Roger
continued to be. He paid hardly any attention to
the singing or the jokes which were told, and
seemed to be glad when it was over and he could
return to their quarters and go to bed.</p>

<p>“It must be something pretty serious,” whispered
Phil to Dave, as they retired for the night.</p>

<p>The young corporal was quite surprised when,
early in the morning, he found himself awakened
by Roger, who had come over and touched him
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“As soon as you are dressed, Phil,” whispered
his chum, “I want you to come outside and listen
to something I have to tell you. But don’t say
anything to Dave or the others about it. Slip out
as quietly as you can. I don’t want them to think
that we’ve anything in secret between us.” And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
then before the shipowner’s son could answer,
Roger tiptoed away and commenced to dress rapidly
and silently.</p>

<p>A few minutes later found both of the corporals
outside of the shelter which served them for sleeping
quarters. Then Roger motioned Phil away,
and they walked quite a distance, to a place where
they would be safe from interruption.</p>

<p>“I want to tell you about that letter I received
from Laura yesterday,” began the senator’s son.
“It’s got something in it, Phil, that I don’t like
at all.”</p>

<p>“I hope it isn’t any serious trouble for you,
Roger.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t trouble for me, Phil. That is, except
in a general way—the same way it might affect
you too. It’s trouble for Dave.”</p>

<p>“Dave! Why, what’s happened? Nobody
sick or hurt, I hope?”</p>

<p>“No; it’s nothing like that. Did you ever meet
a young fellow by the name of Max Gebauer?”</p>

<p>Phil thought for a moment. “It seems to me
I did. A tall, thin fellow with blue eyes and light
hair. We met him once or twice at the Wadsworth
jewelry works.”</p>

<p>“That’s the chap. His folks have jewelry
works of some kind in Philadelphia, and this Max
Gebauer came to Crumville to see Mr. Wadsworth
on business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“Well, how does that affect Dave?”</p>

<p>“You just read these few pages from Laura’s
letter,” returned Roger, and handed over the
sheets. Laura had been writing of the entertainments
given in Crumville for the benefit of the
local charities, and added the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And now I have got to write something
which is very distasteful to me, Roger, for it concerns
Jessie and Dave in a way I do not like to
think about.</p>

<p>“At the time we were getting up the principal
entertainment, that young salesman, Max Gebauer,
who, as you will remember, is in the jewelry
business with his father and his uncle in Philadelphia,
was in Crumville to see Mr. Wadsworth.
He is now a lieutenant in the army, and looks
quite spick and span in his new uniform. Mr.
Wadsworth was so enthusiastic to think that Gebauer
had joined the army and was soon going
over to France, he invited him to the house for
dinner.</p>

<p>“We, of course, did our best to entertain him,
and he seemed particularly interested in Jessie—so
much so that he asked her to allow him to do
a number of things connected with the entertainment,
and he likewise purchased ten dollars’ worth
of tickets from her, which, of course, pleased her
a good deal. Then, when the entertainment came
off, he presented her with a beautiful bouquet of
American Beauty roses, and later still gave her a
very handsome Red Cross emblem, which, it
seems, their firm has something to do with manufacturing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
He gave the pin to Mr. Wadsworth
to give to Jessie, so that she had no chance to refuse
it even if she wanted to.</p>

<p>“Since that time he has been to Crumville three
times, and on each occasion managed to call on
Jessie. Once while he was out in an automobile
he met her on the outskirts of the town, where she
had been visiting one of our poor families, and insisted
on taking her for a ride.</p>

<p>“Now, I don’t think Jessie intends to do anything
that is mean, but Gebauer is well educated,
and can make himself very pleasing when he tries,
and he has certainly done everything in his power
to attract her. She, of course, feels flattered at
the attentions of an army officer, and I know some
of the other girls in Crumville are beginning to
envy her just a little and some are talking about
her.</p>

<p>“Now, I suppose, Roger, you will wonder at
once why I have not had a straight talk with Jessie
and why I haven’t told her exactly what I think
of all this. Well, to do that is not easy with such
a girl as she is. As an only child she has been
very much petted and allowed to have her own
way, and she often sees no wrong at all in things
which I sometimes think might be different. I did
mention once, in an offhand way, that I thought
Gebauer was growing too attentive, but she merely
laughed and tossed her head and told me there
was nothing I needed to worry about. And then
she told me, a while later, she didn’t understand
why Dave didn’t write oftener—that she had not
had a letter from him for two weeks.</p>

<p>“All of this makes me greatly worried, but I do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
not know what to do. Once or twice I have
thought of speaking to Mrs. Wadsworth, but I
am afraid that might only make matters worse.
She doesn’t seem to notice how attentive Gebauer
has become or notice how some folks are talking
about Jessie. I wish the lieutenant would get orders
to leave for France at once.”</p>
</div>

<p>Phil read the sheets through twice before he
handed them back to Roger. Then the chums
looked at each other thoughtfully. Roger was
the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>“Do you wonder I was worried after I read
that?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“It certainly is fierce!” was Phil’s comment.
“But, Roger, you don’t suppose for a minute
that Jessie would go back on Dave?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how it could be possible—unless
the sight of the lieutenant in his uniform has completely
turned Jessie’s head.”</p>

<p>“But Jessie’s too sensible for anything like
that, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“I should hope so, Phil. But you never can
tell. You know there are lots of girls who for
some reason or other don’t seem to be able to
resist a uniform. Even the cook feels flattered by
the fireman or the policeman.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but Dave’s in uniform, and he’s a sergeant.”</p>

<p>“True. But he is over three thousand miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
away, while this Gebauer is right on the spot. I
wish, as Laura says, that Gebauer would get his
orders to leave at once.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the best thing that could happen.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether to mention this to Dave
or not,” went on Roger, after a pause. “I don’t
want to worry him needlessly, and at the same
time I think he ought to know what is going on at
home.”</p>

<p>“I know he has been writing to Jessie regularly.
I saw him send off the letters myself.”</p>

<p>“I know that, too. It must be the fault of the
post-office that she doesn’t get them.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t get any letter this time from Jessie,
and that I am afraid is making him feel quite
blue. He heard from his Uncle Dunston, and
that’s all.”</p>

<p>The two talked the matter over for several minutes
more, and then reached the conclusion that it
might be as well to remain silent on the subject
for at least several days longer, trusting that during
that period a letter might come from Jessie
which would clear up the situation.</p>

<p>During the past few days the ammunition dump
which Dave had discovered, and part of which
had been blown up, had been subject to an investigation
by those in authority. Several hundred
shells were found unexploded, and these were
taken to a safe place and stored away. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
learned that a mine had been placed on the old
trail through the wood, and this had gone up,
doing, however, no further damage than to uproot
some trees and brushwood.</p>

<p>Dave received permission to visit the spot and
did so in company with Phil and Ben, Roger remaining
behind to favor his hurt ankle, which
still pained him a little.</p>

<p>The young sergeant was, of course, anxious to
find his lost wrist-watch, and a search was instituted
which lasted the best part of half a day.
But it was of no avail—the timepiece could not
be located.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s of no use—we might as well give
it up,” said Dave at last. “Come on, we’ll go
back to camp.”</p>

<p>And this they did. The young sergeant felt
decidedly blue, and he had two things to make him
feel so: the loss of the watch and the fact that he
had not heard from Jessie for some time.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>A BATTLE IN THE AIR</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Phew</span>, but this is hot!”</p>

<p>“I guess we’re going to pay up for that wet
weather we had.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how many more miles we’ve got to
hike over this road?”</p>

<p>“No less than three, so the top sergeant told
me,” answered Dave, to whom the question was
put.</p>

<p>It was about a week after the events narrated
in the last chapter, and the fighting engineers, as
they were familiarly called, were once more forging
toward the battle front. The storms of the
past three weeks had cleared away, and the hot
summer sun beat down upon them with all its intensity.</p>

<p>During the time spent in camp Roger had recovered
from the injury to his ankle and was now
around as before. He had had another conversation
with Phil regarding the letter received from
Laura, and both had again decided not to say anything
to Dave concerning Max Gebauer. But
they had spoken to Dave in a casual way about his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
not receiving a letter from Jessie and had said
that possibly she was not getting the letters he had
forwarded.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t do anything more than write
and mail the letters,” had been the young sergeant’s
reply to this. Nevertheless, his chums
had noticed with satisfaction that he wrote another
letter to Jessie that very evening and was particular
to see that it was properly addressed and
taken care of.</p>

<p>In the meantime Roger had forwarded his
reply to Dave’s sister, and in that communication
he told Laura he hoped she would keep her eyes
on Jessie and see that Gebauer did not have a
chance to become intimate with the girl. He
also asked Dave’s sister to send him word if anything
out of the ordinary occurred.</p>

<p>The engineers were moving along with their
full equipment on their backs. Behind them
came a string of motor-lorries, carrying great
quantities of tools, and also some explosives.</p>

<p>By nightfall they had reached a spot not far
from the fighting front. They had turned off
from the main road and were now passing
through a small French hamlet, beyond which
was a small hill hedged in on all sides by a thick
forest.</p>

<p>“Orders are to clear a road around one side
of this hill, and do it as quickly as possible,” announced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
Captain Obray. “We’ll have to blast
out some of the rocks and cut down a number of
trees, I am afraid.”</p>

<p>The work was started early in the morning,
after a night which was not altogether a comfortable
one. There was a rumor throughout the
camp that the Germans might make a raid over
No Man’s Land, probably with the idea of obtaining
some prisoners from whom they could
obtain much-desired information. Consequently
the engineers were all more or less on their
guard.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t want to become a German
prisoner,” remarked Ben. “From what I’ve
heard, they don’t treat their prisoners very well.”</p>

<p>“Well!” cried Phil. “They treat ’em the
meanest ever!”</p>

<p>“Say, that puts me in mind of a story I heard
the other day,” said Shadow. “Oh, this is
true!” he added hastily, when he saw several of
the others shake their heads. “A tall, lanky
Western doughboy was at the front on duty at
night when he heard somebody approaching.
He immediately called to the fellow to halt.
Then he discovered that the fellow was walking
with both hands high in the air and muttering
something to himself. The fellow kept coming
on until he was right at the end of the doughboy’s
bayonet. Then the doughboy gave him a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
little jab, and the fellow set up a scream and suddenly
opened his eyes. He was a German soldier
and a sleep-walker. Of course, the doughboy
made him a prisoner without delay.”</p>

<p>“Wow! what do you think of that?” cried
Ben.</p>

<p>“Say, Shadow, you be careful that you don’t
do any sleep-walking yourself, like you did at
Oak Hall,” broke in Phil. “You don’t want to
go over No Man’s Land and get on the ridge-pole
of some schoolhouse, like you did when we
were at the Hall,” he continued, referring to an
incident the particulars of which were given in
“Dave Porter and His Classmates.”</p>

<p>“I’ve given up walking in my sleep. It
doesn’t pay,” returned the story-teller quickly.</p>

<p>“Talking about the sleep-walker giving himself
up,” put in Dave, “I heard a pretty good
story the other day about a German who met one
of our men at the edge of the wood. He showed
a white handkerchief—or at least a handkerchief
that had once been white—and then came
over to talk to the sentry. He said he had once
been in Chicago and liked our country first rate,
and he was willing to surrender, provided the
sentry would let him go back and get his brother
and his cousin, so that they could all keep together
and not feel lonely.”</p>

<p>“And did the sentry do it?” queried Roger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“Yes, after he had taken away the fellow’s
gun and helmet. The young German was gone
about a quarter of an hour, and then came back
followed by four others. They were his cousin
and his brother, and two friends who had likewise
concluded to give themselves up. You can
imagine how proud that doughboy was to march
that gang of five prisoners into camp.”</p>

<p>For three days the engineering unit to which
our friends belonged, aided by another unit from
the East and two from the Middle West, toiled
at the task which had been assigned to them.
Here and there the rocks barred their passage,
and these were blasted out as the easiest means
of getting rid of them. Not a few tall trees
were chopped down, and over two hundred of
the engineers were set to work clearing away the
brushwood. In the meantime another unit of
engineers worked on a path leading to the top of
the hill, and a little later a masked battery was
stationed there, ready to open fire on the German
lines northeast of that vicinity.</p>

<p>It must not be surmised that the work the engineers
had to do was without peril. Even
though the spot was deep in the woods and somewhat
isolated, not a few German shells of large
caliber were sent in that direction.</p>

<p>“Confound it! those shells are coming too
close for comfort,” remarked Phil, one afternoon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
when a projectile had gone whining over
their heads to fall less than a hundred yards behind
them.</p>

<p>So far they had not seen any airplanes in that
vicinity, but on the following morning early they
espied two German scout-planes high in the air
circling slowly about.</p>

<p>“I suppose they suspected something was going
on around here and they have sent out those
machines to make sure,” remarked Frank Andrews
to our hero. “I wish our own airmen
would get after them.”</p>

<p>His wish was soon gratified. Looking in the
direction where they knew the American aviation
camp was stationed, the engineers presently saw
four of the planes taking the flight upward.
They came on straight for the spot where the engineers
were working, and those below made up
their minds that a battle in the air was imminent.</p>

<p>“Gee, I hope our men get those fellows!”
cried Roger. “It will serve ’em right for coming
here to spy on us.”</p>

<p>As the four American aviators advanced they
spread out, two keeping somewhat to the rear
while the third headed northward and the fourth
southward. Thus they soon formed a sort of
semicircle around the German planes.</p>

<p>By this time the enemy airmen had probably
made all the observations they wished or that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
they felt capable of making, and they turned
back, evidently with the intention of passing over
their own lines.</p>

<p>“If only we had an anti-aircraft gun here and
could take a few shots at them!” sighed Dave.</p>

<p>The American fliers were still somewhat to the
rear, but when they saw the two enemy scout-planes
trying to escape they opened fire on them.
Even at that distance the flashes from the guns
could be seen, although if there were any sounds
they were lost in the explosions of the motors
and the distant firing of artillery.</p>

<p>The contest in the air now grew so exciting
that nearly all the engineers stopped work to witness
it. One of the American airmen could evidently
get no speed out of his machine, and soon
he fell behind. But the other three kept on, and
one of them presently came close to one of the
enemy planes. Then came a sudden flash of fire,
and the German plane was seen to crumple up
and come down, a mile or more beyond the edge
of the forest.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! they’ve got one of them anyhow,”
exclaimed Ben.</p>

<p>“And now for the other!” added Shadow.</p>

<p>The flight of the other plane continued, but
soon it was evident the German felt he could not
escape by straight flying. He suddenly made a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
dive to the northward, and then began to mount
higher and higher, circling and twisting first in
one direction and then in another. The three
Americans went after him as quickly as they
could, firing their machine-guns whenever it
seemed advantageous to do so. The American
airmen had, of course, to be careful so that they
might not fire into each other.</p>

<p>“That’s a battle royal, all right enough,” was
Dave’s comment, as the contest kept up as vigorously
as ever. “If that German escapes he’ll
certainly have won his liberty.”</p>

<p>The fourth American plane had now dropped
back still further, and soon it began to head for
the aviation camp, suffering probably from engine
or other trouble. Then one of the other
planes began to move away. A minute later its
motor began to miss fire, and then stopped completely.</p>

<p>“See, he’s out of it!” cried Roger. “He’s
going to volplane to the ground.”</p>

<p>“He’ll be lucky if he reaches the ground without
breaking his neck,” announced Phil. And
he was right; the second American had all he
could do to bring his machine down in safety beyond
the big trees of the forest.</p>

<p>With but two of the Americans left in the fight,
the German airman seemed to pluck up courage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
He did not attempt to do any firing, but made a
new turn or two, and then started away, as if to
try once more for the German lines.</p>

<p>But now he reckoned without the cleverness of
one of the American airmen. This fellow put
on a sudden burst of speed and, like a bird on
the wing, he came directly behind the German.
His machine-gun began to spit spitefully, and a
moment later those on the ground far below saw
a portion of the German plane drop away from
the machine proper.</p>

<p>“Hello, there goes his rudder!” cried Captain
Obray, who was looking through his field
glasses. “The whole steering apparatus has
been shot away! Now I reckon he’s about done
for.”</p>

<p>That was indeed the plight of the German airman,
for with the rudder gone, he was practically
helpless to guide his machine. His motor stopped—whether
he turned it off or it stopped of itself
they could not tell—and then the scout machine
began to turn and twist in a fantastic course down
from the sky.</p>

<p>“That’s the end of that flying man,” was
Ben’s comment.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he’s doing anything at all to
save himself?” said Dave.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what he can do,” returned Roger.</p>

<p>This way and that way rushed the helpless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
war-plane. As it came down it made several
turns, and then headed suddenly toward the forest
where the engineers were working.</p>

<p>“It’s coming down pretty close to this spot!”
exclaimed Dave.</p>

<p>“Take care of yourselves, men!” cried Captain
Obray. “Don’t give that plane a chance
to hit you!” He had not forgotten the accident
which had happened to Roger, Phil and
Dave when a plane had come down in flames, as
related in our last volume.</p>

<p>All of the engineers were on the alert. But
this caution was unnecessary. Another dart or
two through the sky, and then the enemy airplane
finally came down at a point in the forest some
distance away. As it did this it burst into flames,
and soon those on the ground saw a heavy smoke
coming up from the spot where it was burning up.</p>

<p>“I wonder if the fellow who was running it
escaped?” cried Phil.</p>

<p>“Let us go and see,” returned Dave; and,
having received the necessary permission, the
young sergeant hurried off through the forest
toward the burning airplane, taking a detail of
eight young engineers with him.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>THE GERMAN AVIATOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> smoke from the burning airplane was
plainly visible over the tops of the trees, so that
Dave and the detail of engineers under him had
no difficulty in heading in the right direction.</p>

<p>But to get through that tangle of underbrush
and over the jagged rocks was not easy, and consequently
their progress was rather slow, even
though they pushed along as vigorously as circumstances
permitted.</p>

<p>“If that airman came down in his burning
plane he has probably been burned up,” remarked
Phil, as they hurried along.</p>

<p>“I hope not,” returned Dave. “I hope he
escaped and we have the honor of capturing him.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad the plane caught fire,” put in
Roger. He knew that the rival air forces liked
very much to capture an enemy plane intact, or
nearly so. On such a plane they would often find
maps and instruments, not to say anything of machine-guns.</p>

<p>At last they came in sight of the burning plane,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
which still blazed forth fiercely. It was caught
in the branches of a low tree. Its gasoline tanks
had burst and the inflammable fluid had run
down over the tree trunk making of it a great
torch.</p>

<p>As the engineers reached a little opening to
one side of where the scout-plane and the tree
were blazing fiercely, they heard a shrill cry
in German for help.</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” burst from Phil’s lips, and
he pointed with his hand as he spoke.</p>

<p>All gazed in the direction indicated and saw
something which filled them with horror.
Caught in a fork of one of the limbs of the tree
was the German aviator. His jacket had become
fastened on the branch, and he was trying
vainly to extricate himself from his perilous position.
The flames were already within three
feet of him, and the back of his heavy fur jacket
was singed and smoking.</p>

<p>“He’ll be burned up as sure as fate!” cried
Ben.</p>

<p>“He will be unless we can save him,” returned
Dave.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you are going to do it,
Dave,” remarked Shadow. “How are you going
to reach him?”</p>

<p>The helpless airman was at least twenty feet
from the ground. All he could do was to twist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
himself in his perilous position, but to get free
from the limb seemed impossible.</p>

<p>“Gee! he doesn’t seem to make much of an
effort to free himself,” observed one of the other
engineers. He did not realize the truth of the
situation, which was that the apparently helpless
man was suffering from a broken arm and a dislocated
shoulder.</p>

<p>The gasoline from the broken tanks had flowed
over the brushwood at the foot of the tree, and
this was now causing the flames to mount up directly
under the German. This being the case,
even had he freed himself he would have
dropped into the fire.</p>

<p>Dave was the first to act. His quick eye had
noted a tall tree standing five or six yards away,
and he made for this without delay.</p>

<p>“Boost me up, you fellows, and be quick
about it; and then some of you follow me,” he
ordered.</p>

<p>Roger and Phil helped him to mount into the
tree, and then the two of them, aided by the
other engineers, came up also. By this time
Dave had selected the limb he wished to utilize,
and he crawled slowly out on this, testing its
strength as he progressed.</p>

<p>“It’s plenty strong enough to hold all of us,”
he announced to his two chums. “Come on out.
I want it to bend down as much as possible.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>By this time the others understood the scheme
which had entered our hero’s head. The tall
tree was a wide-spreading one, and the branch
he had selected bent over in the direction of the
tree which was on fire. Soon the combined
weight of the three engineers caused it to bend
until the outer end was directly over the spot
where the German aviator rested.</p>

<p>“Now you fellows get back a little and I’ll
go forward,” said Dave. “As soon as I’ve got
hold of him you go back farther yet, so that the
weight of the four of us won’t crack the branch
off.”</p>

<p>Phil and Roger understood, and as Dave went
forward they retreated just enough so that the
outer end of the branch might remain in practically
the same position.</p>

<p>It was a perilous climb for the young sergeant,
and no one realized this more than himself.
Being directly over the branch where the German
rested, he was likewise over that portion of the
brushwood below which was on fire. The smoke
was coming up thickly, choking and blinding him.</p>

<p>At last he was out to within three feet of the
end of the limb. He had his legs around it
firmly, and now he bent down and by teetering
the limb just a trifle managed to get within distance
of the fellow below.</p>

<p>The German aviator had continued to call for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
help in his own language. Now, as Dave drew
closer, he heard the talk of the Americans and
cried out in broken English:</p>

<p>“You safe me, blease! You safe me, blease!”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it if I can, Fritzie,” answered Dave.
“Give me your hand.”</p>

<p>“I gif vun hand! Other arm broken!”
gasped out the hurt airman.</p>

<p>As well as he was able, he put out his uninjured
arm, and Dave grasped it. Then, holding
tight with his legs, the young sergeant succeeded
in raising the fellow from his position in the
crotch of the branch which had now taken fire.
He had to pull with considerable force to get the
fellow free from his entanglement.</p>

<p>“Look out, Dave, or you’ll both fall!”
warned Phil.</p>

<p>“I’ve got him, but I don’t just see how I’m
going to get him down from the tree,” announced
our hero.</p>

<p>The smoke was now coming up so thickly that
he was almost blinded, and both he and the
hurt aviator began coughing.</p>

<p>“Swing him around so that we can get hold
of him,” suggested Roger.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_p066a">

Dave grasped it.</span>—<i>Page <a href="#Page_66">66</a>.</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With great care Dave shifted his position, and
then worked his way backward about a foot
along the limb. Here he felt a little more secure,
and then swung the hurt man around until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
Phil and Roger could get hold of him. The
German uttered several moans of pain and then
collapsed into insensibility.</p>

<p>“Be careful how you handle him, fellows,”
said Dave, when he and his chums had the airman
safe between them. “He said his arm was
broken.”</p>

<p>“He can be thankful he didn’t break his neck
with such a tumble as that,” returned Roger.</p>

<p>One of the engineers on the ground below had
a strong rope with him, and this was thrown
over the limb of the tree. A noose was placed
around the German’s body, and then he was
slowly and carefully lowered to the ground, after
which Dave and the others descended from the
tree.</p>

<p>While the rescue was taking place three of the
engineers had gone around to the other side of
the blaze, trying to get at the burning plane.
They had managed with long sticks to poke a few
things away from the fusilage, but these proved
to be of but little importance and were carried
off by all of the crowd merely as souvenirs.</p>

<p>The German was still insensible, and it was
not until he had been carried to a safe distance
and the engineers had dashed some water
into his face that he recovered and opened his
eyes. In the meantime, five of the men were detailed
to watch the fire and see to it that it burned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
itself out without starting a general conflagration
through the forest.</p>

<p>“We don’t want these woods burned up just
yet,” was the way Dave expressed himself.
“We need the trees to screen our operations in
this vicinity.”</p>

<p>The prisoner proved to be a man not over twenty-five
years of age. That he was well educated
was evident. Like most aviators, he was of
slight build, and he had light hair and gray eyes.
He gave his name as Heinrich Eberhardt, and
told the aviation unit to which he belonged.</p>

<p>“I am very thankful to you for having saved
my life,” he said, in his broken English, to Dave
and the others. “If you had not come to my
aid, I would have been burned up,” and he shuddered.</p>

<p>“I’d hate to see anybody burned alive,” returned
Dave. Then he questioned the aviator
about himself and learned that the fellow had
leaped from the burning scout-plane while he was
yet a hundred feet or more above the tree.</p>

<p>“Had I not done that I would have been
burned alive in mid-air,” continued Heinrich
Eberhardt, in his broken English. “Such
things often happen. One of my best friends
was burned up that way last year.”</p>

<p>As the hurt aviator was in no condition to
walk, word was sent back to the camp of the engineers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
and a little later hospital men came after
him with a stretcher. This, however, took some
time, and in the meanwhile Dave had an opportunity
to ask the fellow some questions, being
glad to know that the man could speak English,
even though brokenly.</p>

<p>“I and my twin brother, Fritz, are alone in
the world,” said Heinrich Eberhardt. “Both
of our parents died when we were small boys,
and we were brought up by an uncle who had
spent a few years in America and England. He
could speak English very well indeed, and he insisted
upon it that we learn something of the language,
stating that it would be good for us in
business. But neither my brother Fritz nor I
cared to study any too well, so we didn’t learn
any more than we had to,” and Heinrich Eberhardt
smiled faintly. Dave and the others had
rendered him what first aid they could, and made
him as comfortable as possible on a pile of
brushwood. He was, of course, suffering much
pain, but he was too plucky to complain.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of the war?” questioned
Roger.</p>

<p>“I think it’s a bad affair—a very bad affair
indeed, especially for the English and the Americans,”
answered the German aviator readily.</p>

<p>“Then you still think Germany will win?” put
in Phil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“To be sure. Why not?” returned the German
in his broken English. “No combination
of nations can master the <i>Vaterland</i>. It cannot
be done. We are too strong for them. We
have too much system and too much science.”</p>

<p>“But what do you think of the American
army?” questioned Dave.</p>

<p>At this Heinrich Eberhardt pursed up his lips
and was silent for a moment.</p>

<p>“You have been very good to me, so why
should I say anything against you?” he answered
finally. “But if you must know the truth, let
me say I think you can do little or nothing in
this war. You are too far away. Your President
may send a few hundred thousand men over
here, but that will count for nothing.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know we have over a million men
in France already?” demanded Phil.</p>

<p>“A million? Oh, no, nothing like that! You
couldn’t possibly get them here. Our U-boats
would stop your troopships and sink them. At
the most, you may get over a few hundred thousand.
But I doubt very much if it will be that
many.”</p>

<p>“Some day you’ll have your eyes opened to
the truth of what is going on,” said Dave.
“But now you had better keep quiet. I have
sent for the stretcher-bearers, and I think they’ll
get here before long, and then they’ll carry you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
to the hospital, where you will get proper treatment.”</p>

<p>“Could you send word back that I am alive?”
asked the hurt man eagerly.</p>

<p>“I guess that can be arranged through the
Allied airmen,” answered Dave. He knew that
there was an unwritten law among all the fliers of
the various nations that word concerning any airman
who was killed, injured, or captured, should
be carried over the enemies’ lines by means of a
note dropped from some flying machine.</p>

<p>“If that is done I shall be very, very grateful,”
said Heinrich Eberhardt. “I want my
brother Fritz to know that I am alive.”</p>

<p>Presently the stretcher-bearers came into view,
and Dave saw to it personally that the captured
German received proper attention. Then the
aviator was taken away.</p>

<p>“Not a half bad sort,” was Roger’s comment,
when he and the others were making their way
back to the engineering camp.</p>

<p>“They’ve all got the same idea regarding the
United States,” answered Dave. “They think
it’s impossible for Uncle Sam to get a big army
over here. They won’t believe the story that
we already have over a million men in the field.”</p>

<p>“And another million or two on the way,”
added Phil.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a tremendous undertaking,” broke in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
Ben. “Think of sending so many men as that
on a sea voyage of three thousand miles, and
then taking care of them after they arrive!”</p>

<p>“It is a big undertaking,” said Shadow.
“And it’s no wonder that it takes billions of dollars
to do it.”</p>

<p>“It must be exciting to be an army aviator,”
continued Dave. “Far more exciting than being
just an engineer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know about that,” answered
Roger. “Of course, some of the airmen—especially
those who get to be aces—have plenty
of things happen to them. But I was talking to
one of the French aviators not long ago—one
who has been in the service since the war started—and
he said all he had been able to do was to
go up and take observations and report. There
couldn’t be anything very exciting about that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve had excitement enough—no doubt
of that,” returned Dave. “And it looks to me as
if there was a good deal more excitement ahead.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, Dave!” cried Roger. “I’ll
wager before we know it we’ll be in the very thick
of it.”</p>

<small>THE PERILS OF ROAD BUILDING</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">We’ve</span> got it hot enough now, Dave.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you, Roger. The Huns are
certainly bombarding us for fair.”</p>

<p>“Did you see that tree come down a few minutes
ago?” asked Phil. “It landed within a
dozen feet of Captain Obray and Frank Andrews.”</p>

<p>“The German air scouts—those three fellows
who sailed this way yesterday afternoon—must
have sent in word of where we were located
and what we were doing,” continued Dave.
“It’s too bad our men didn’t get a chance to
bring them down as they did those others.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what they did with that Heinrich
Eberhardt?” broke in Shadow, who was working
in the gang with the others.</p>

<p>“He is in the hospital, and I heard yesterday
that he is doing very well,” answered Dave.</p>

<p>“I wish we were sure poor Buster was going
to get over that gas attack,” went on the former
story-teller of Oak Hall. “Gee! it’s a shame
that he was knocked out that way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“As soon as I can get off I’m going to take a
run back to the hospital and see how Buster is
making it,” said Dave. “I think I’m entitled to
a leave of absence; I haven’t been off since last
winter.”</p>

<p>“If you do get off, I’ll try to get off at the
same time,” cried Roger quickly.</p>

<p>“And so will I,” added Phil.</p>

<p>Ten days had passed since the spectacular rescue
of the Hun aviator from the burning plane
and tree, and during that time the fighting engineers
had well deserved the appellation applied
to them. They had advanced their road
through the forest for a considerable distance,
and had had two brushes with the enemy, one a
night raid which had come most unexpectedly;
but the blood of the engineers had been up, and
they had beaten the Germans back with the loss
of but two men slightly wounded, while three of
the enemy had been killed and one taken prisoner.</p>

<p>They had also been under artillery fire on more
than one occasion, and now this artillery fire was
again directed toward them.</p>

<p>“If those Germans were only a little better
marksmen there wouldn’t be anything left of us, I
imagine,” remarked Phil a little later, after a
shell had gone whining over their heads, to explode
among some roots in the rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“I don’t believe it’s altogether a case of their
marksmanship,” returned Dave. “I had a talk
with Captain Obray one day, and he said information
had come in that the German ammunition
was steadily deteriorating, due I suppose, to the
fact that they can’t get hold of the metal and
chemicals they would like to use.”</p>

<p>The young engineers had been working on a
small exposed length of the roadway, but now
came orders to advance to a point where they
would be sheltered in part by a series of rocks
and heavy trees.</p>

<p>Suddenly came a sound from their rear which
gave them intense satisfaction. During the past
week the road up the little hill behind them had
been completed, and an American battery had
been located there. This battery now opened
with vigor, sending toward the German lines at
least four shells for every one coming the other
way.</p>

<p>“That will teach the Heinies a lesson,” remarked
Phil grimly. “I hope some of our shells
reach their batteries and put them out of commission.”</p>

<p>“I guess we all hope that, Phil,” returned
Dave.</p>

<p>The bombardment from both sides increased
in intensity as the day advanced. And it must
be admitted that all of the engineers worked under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
a tremendous nervous strain, not knowing at
what instant a shell might explode among them,
causing much destruction.</p>

<p>“No use in talking, Dave, we are taking our
lives in our hands here, in spite of the protection
of the rocks and trees,” remarked Roger.</p>

<p>He had scarcely uttered the words when a
shell came over the trees in front of them, to hit
the rocks a short distance to their left. It
exploded with tremendous force, scattering pieces
of shrapnel, bits of wood, loose stones, and
chunks of dirt in all directions.</p>

<p>Dave was hit in the chin by a small stone, and
a stick of wood caught him directly across the
stomach, doubling him up for the time being.
Roger and some of the others were also struck,
while Ben received a shower of dirt in his eyes
which almost blinded him.</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar!” exclaimed Phil, after the
excitement attending the explosion had somewhat
subsided. “That’s getting almost too close for
comfort.”</p>

<p>“Anybody seriously injured?” questioned the
young sergeant, as he wiped a little blood from
his chin and put his hand down on his stomach,
which felt sore from the blow.</p>

<p>“I’ve got about a pound of dirt in my eyes,”
answered Ben, as he started to wipe his optics
with a corner of his handkerchief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>No one had been seriously injured, for which
all were thankful, but there were numerous small
cuts and bruises, and the engineers retired closer
to the shelter of the rocks to catch their breath
and attend to their hurts.</p>

<p>“What damage did that shell do?” demanded
Captain Obray, as he came up on the double-quick,
for he had been with a gang some distance
away.</p>

<p>Dave made his report, and the captain looked
the men over.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to keep your eyes and ears open
for those shells,” said the officer. “If you think
they are coming anywhere near you, don’t wait,
but throw yourselves flat on your face. By doing
that you may save your life.”</p>

<p>A little later the engineers were out on the
roadway working as industriously as ever. Only
one man remained behind, he having fallen over
some rough rocks and bruised his elbows.</p>

<p>It was almost nightfall, and the bombardment
seemed to be slowing up, when Dave found himself
with the gang under him at a turn in the
roadway which was being constructed. Here on
one side were several walls of rocks, while on the
other the roadway was lined with a series of
heavy trees backed up in some places by thick
brushwood.</p>

<p>“Almost time to knock off, isn’t it?” said Ben.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
He had put in an unusually big day, and his back
ached.</p>

<p>“We’ll knock off in about an hour, Ben,” answered
Dave. “Pretty heavy work, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I never thought I’d work as hard as this
in my whole life, Dave,” answered the son of
the leading real estate dealer of Crumville.
“Gosh! I wonder what my dad and ma would
say if they could see me now? Dad used to think
I didn’t even like to cut the wood at home or
weed the garden, and just look at all the wood-cutting
I’ve done, not to say anything about shoveling
dirt, hauling stone, and building trenches
and dugouts.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, we’ve got a good reason for
doing this, Ben. When you come to think of that
reason it makes it worth while, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Indeed it does, Dave! And don’t think for
a minute that I’m complaining. If doing this
kind of work is going to help win the war, then
they can depend on my sticking on the job until
we march right into Berlin.”</p>

<p>“Say, wouldn’t that be fine?” exclaimed Phil.
“How I’d like to march down Unter den Linden
singing ‘Over There!’ or some other of our popular
songs!”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Germany will allow the war
to go that far,” answered Dave. “They know
well enough how angry all the Allies are because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
of the wanton destruction in France and Belgium,
and they’ll most likely be afraid that if we got
into Germany we’d start to rip things up the same
way.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean by that, Dave, that they’d give
in before we got into Germany?” demanded
Phil.</p>

<p>“That’s the way I figure it. I don’t believe
they’ll allow any of the Allies to get a foot farther
than the Rhine.”</p>

<p>“How are they going to stop us if we push
our way through?” questioned Ben.</p>

<p>“Only one way to do that, Ben. They’ll have
to ask for peace. And that is what I think they’ll
do. Behind it all, I think the common German
people, as well as their allies, are sick and tired
of the conflict. They have been hemmed in on
all sides for several years, and been unable to
get supplies from the outside world, and the
whole thing hasn’t sat very well on their stomachs.
I think if they could get out of this war
gracefully they would do it in a minute.”</p>

<p>“That aviator we captured didn’t talk that
way.”</p>

<p>“He was putting on a front—that’s all.
Germany may have had some notion that with
the collapse of Russia she might be able to get
the better of France, Italy, and England before
we got into the fight. But now that we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
bringing our men over here by the thousands every
week, she must realize that the jig is up.”</p>

<p>“I can’t see it that way,” said Shadow. “I
think she’ll fight to the last ditch.”</p>

<p>“Well, if she does, Shadow, it will mean a terrible
ending for her. The Allies will keep on
pounding her until there will be nothing left to
pound.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’d like to see!” cried Phil.
“I’d like to march right into Germany and give
them the same dose of medicine that they have
given the poor people here in France and those
in Belgium, not to say anything about the destruction
by the Austrians in Upper Italy.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what is going to happen to Russia,
now that she is out of the war and in a state of
revolution?” remarked Ben.</p>

<p>“That’s a question that nobody can answer
just now,” returned Dave. “It looks to me as if
the different Russian political parties had each
other by the throat and nobody wanted to let
go.”</p>

<p>“It certainly must be a dreadful country to
live in just now,” said Roger, with a shake of his
head. “Neither a person nor his property is
safe.”</p>

<p>The engineers were hard at work cutting
down several small trees which were in the way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
and in hauling some loose stones forward for
the temporary roadway, when the bombardment
from the Germans, which had lessened during the
last half-hour, commenced all over again. Shells
came whistling and whining over the forest, and
in the midst of this came a telephone communication
from the right of the fighting front that the
Germans were preparing to launch another gas
attack.</p>

<p>“I don’t think the attack will reach as far as
this, however,” said Captain Obray. “The
wind is blowing in the opposite direction. However,
we’ll be on our guard, and as soon as the
signal is given I want every man to put on his
mask instantly.”</p>

<p>Dave was just getting ready to tell his men
they might quit their labors for the day when
there came the whining of two shells through the
air. Both fell just a trifle short of the roadway
the engineers were building. Bang! Bang! went
the missiles of death, one report close upon the
other. Then arose a great mass of rocks and
dirt, followed by flying sticks of wood and thin
brush, the latter blown in all directions.</p>

<p>Dave and his men were working close to the
high rocks on the other side of the roadway. As
the shells fell they threw themselves flat, and
most of the flying debris went over them. Then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
following the explosions, came several crashes in
the forest, and three large trees were seen to be
falling across the roadway.</p>

<p>“Get close to the rocks, everybody!” yelled
Dave, as he caught a quick glance of what was
coming. “Look out for the falling trees!”</p>

<p>The words had scarcely left his lips when the
first of the big trees came down, the top hitting
some of the rocks over the engineers’ heads and
sending them in various directions. Then, one
after another, the other trees followed, until the
engineers found themselves completely buried under
a mass of trunks and branches.</p>

<p>Dave had tried to get on his hands and knees
to crawl closer to the high rocks, but as he did
this a branch of one of the trees came down
across his back, sending him flat again. Then
another tree fell on top of the first, and he found
himself held down so tightly that he could
scarcely breathe. Roger was on one side of him,
and he, too, was held so fast he could hardly
move. There were many cries of pain and yells
for help; and in the midst of the excitement there
came a shrill whistle from a distance to notify the
engineers that the German gas attack was on the
way!</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>IN THE THICK OF THE FIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Help</span>! Help! I’m being smothered!”</p>

<p>“Somebody take this tree off my legs!”</p>

<p>“Some smash-up, wasn’t it? I wonder if
anybody was killed?”</p>

<p>These and other cries came from all directions.
Some of the exclamations were considerably smothered
because those uttering them were buried almost
out of sight by the trees and other debris
that had come down on top of them.</p>

<p>“I say, Dave, are you hurt?” cried Phil. He
was a few feet away from our hero, and fortunately
he was free to move about, even though his
face had been scratched by a branch which had
come down close to his head.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know if I am hu—hurt or not,”
gasped the young sergeant. “I ca—can’t
move!”</p>

<p>“And I’m in the same pickle, with this tree
holding down my legs,” returned Roger.</p>

<p>It was at this instant that the shrill whistle
came from a distance—a whistle all the fighting
engineers knew only too well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“A gas attack! A gas attack!” was the cry
which rent the air. “On with your masks,
boys!”</p>

<p>Dave heard the cry, and immediately tried to
make a move to get hold of his mask and adjust
it. But the tree branch held him down in such
a fashion that this was impossible. Roger was
more fortunate, and even though his legs were
held down he managed to twist his body over on
one side and get his mask into position.</p>

<p>“Can you make it, Dave?” questioned Phil,
who now had his mask ready to slip on.</p>

<p>“No. I can’t straighten up enough,” answered
our hero.</p>

<p>“I’ll see if I can’t get the limb out of the
way,” went on Phil; and then called to Ben and
Shadow, who, fortunately, were as free as himself
to move about, to assist him.</p>

<p>The three slipped on their masks, and then under
the directions of Phil went to work to raise
the branch that was holding Dave down. By
their united efforts they managed to get it up just
enough to enable our hero to crawl from under.
As soon as this was accomplished Dave lost no
time in putting on his mask.</p>

<p>Even with the united efforts of the four young
engineers, it was impossible to raise the limb
which held down Roger’s legs. So two axes
were brought forward, and while some held up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
the limb so that it might not injure the fallen
one’s legs, Dave and Phil chopped the branch almost
through, so that it was then cast aside with
ease and the senator’s son was able to stand up.</p>

<p>By this time all the other engineers had gotten
word concerning the mishap and were flocking
to that vicinity to aid their comrades. Three
men were still under the wreckage, and it was
not without great difficulty that these were released.
One poor fellow had his shoulder badly
bruised and had to be sent to the hospital.</p>

<p>Shadow had one hand much scratched, and both
of his shins scraped, and he, too, had to be sent to
the rear to receive medical attention.</p>

<p>Long before the rescues came to an end
the gas was on the engineers. It rolled toward
them in a thin yellowish cloud. But fortunately
the wind was coming up strongly, and this soon
dissipated the gas so that it did little damage.</p>

<p>“I think we came out of that disaster remarkably
well,” was Captain Obray’s comment, after
he had made a survey of the damage wrought by
the two German shells.</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder to me that all of you weren’t
killed,” remarked Frank Andrews. “Just look
at the holes those two shells made behind where
the trees stood.”</p>

<p>So far Dave had been so interested in what
had occurred to himself and his companions that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
he had not looked at the spot. Now he walked
to that vicinity, and his eyes opened widely when
he beheld the two shell craters. One was all of
twenty feet in diameter and probably fifteen feet
deep in the center, while the other crater, through
some freak of nature, was shaped like a trench,
ten feet wide and about as deep and nearly three
times as long.</p>

<p>“Those must have been some of the largest of
the Hun shells,” was Phil’s opinion. “Gee!
when those holes fill with water there will be a
regular pond here.”</p>

<p>“The Heinies couldn’t have made a neater
job of it, try their best, if they were aiming to
block this roadway,” said Ben. “It’s going to
be a job to clear the way again.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t the worst of it, Ben,” returned
Dave. “Now that they have got our range they
may be sending more shells this way.”</p>

<p>It was fortunate that the shock of the explosions
had come just as the day’s work was drawing to
a close. After so much excitement nobody felt
like going to work again, and the young engineers
were glad enough to seek their shelter, there
to care for their hurts and to rest until supper
was announced.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that some of the engineers
were a trifle nervous when operations were resumed
the following morning. But the bombardment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
on both sides had ceased, and everything
throughout the forest was as quiet as it had
formerly been. The work of clearing the roadway
was started without delay, and this having
been completed, the gang under Dave was sent
forward for a full quarter of a mile. Here there
was a small ravine, and the engineers were instructed
to bridge it in a rough but substantial
manner, so that some field artillery would be able
to cross without danger.</p>

<p>“This is what I call bridge-building with a
vengeance,” remarked Ben, when the task was in
progress. “I wonder what the folks at home
would say if we threw such a structure as this
across Dixon’s gully or the brook back of Henderson’s
apple orchard?”</p>

<p>“Well, they’d have to give us credit for building
something substantial if not ornamental,
Ben,” answered Dave, with a grin. “When we
get through with it, a herd of elephants could use
it without fear of a collapse.”</p>

<p>“And just think of building it in two days!”
exclaimed Phil. “Why, ordinarily it would
take local bridge-builders two or three weeks to
put up such a thing as this.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, in war, speed is what counts,” answered
our hero.</p>

<p>At the time appointed a road through the forest,
with three bridges spanning as many gullies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
was completed. And then one night, following
a heavy bombardment and a barrage fire, the
American forces moved forward.</p>

<p>This brought on a battle which lasted the best
part of a day and a half. There were attacks
and counter-attacks, and the din of the light and
heavy field-pieces was terrific. The Germans did
everything possible to shove the Americans and
the French back, but in the end had to give way,
and when the battle finally subsided the Allied
forces had made an advance of from four to six
miles on a front twenty-two miles long, and captured
three villages.</p>

<p>“How is that for fighting?” cried Dave enthusiastically,
when the news of the advance was
confirmed. “We’ll show them yet what it means
to bring Uncle Sam into this war.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we will!” returned Roger.</p>

<p>“If only we could rush them right along to
the Rhine!” came from Phil.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the engineers were
idle while this great battle was going on. They
were called upon to repair two of the bridges,
both of which were partly demolished by German
shell-fire, and then they were sent to the front
once more to lay out a new line of trenches.
This was perilous work in the extreme.</p>

<p>“We’re going under fire again, men,” announced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
Captain Obray, when the command
came to go to the front.</p>

<p>This meant that each engineer must carry his
rifle as well as the entrenching tools assigned to
him. Along with the load on his back this was
a weight of eighty to ninety pounds per man, certainly
something of a load to carry over rough
roads and through a tangle of underbrush and
loose and jagged rocks. More than one man
grew exhausted, and had to either rest up or be
carried to the rear.</p>

<p>“Here is where sheer bone and muscle count,”
was Dave’s comment, as he ploughed forward
through some underbrush with the detail under
him. It was a warm summer day, and all the engineers
were perspiring freely.</p>

<p>“I wish we had had this to do last winter when
it was colder,” remarked Ben.</p>

<p>“Oh, for some ice cream soda!” sighed
Roger.</p>

<p>“Say, that puts me in mind of a story,” cried
Shadow. “A small boy came to his mother in
the winter time with a big idea. He had six
snowballs in his arms, and brought them right
into the house. ‘What are you going to do with
those snowballs, Bobby?’ asked his mother. ‘I
want you to put ’em away in your closet where
you keep the jam,’ answered the small boy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
‘What do you want to do that for?’ ‘Oh,’
said the small boy, ‘I want you to keep ’em until
next summer for me, and then when I can’t have
any ice cream I’ll go and get a snowball.’”
And at this joke there was a slight smile.</p>

<p>“There is only one good thing about that
joke, Shadow,” remarked Dave. “It makes a
fellow think of winter, and believe me it’s a good
thing to think of ice and snow when the thermometer
is up in the nineties as it is to-day.”</p>

<p>Presently came the command to halt, and then
the young engineers were instructed to crawl forward
with caution to a line already mapped out
by Frank Andrews and several of the experienced
linemen under him. As soon as the line was
gained the engineers must lose no time in digging
themselves in, so that no stray bullets from the
German trenches might catch them.</p>

<p>Dave had been in such a position before, so
there was nothing in the way of novelty about it.
He well knew the peril of the work, and he cautioned
all under him to be careful in exposing
themselves.</p>

<p>“Those Germans are as mad as hornets for
being driven back,” he remarked; “and they
would more than glory in it to lay out some of
our fellows. And remember, while you are
working I want all of you to have your guns
handy, so that if they show themselves or try<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
to reach us we can give a good account of ourselves.”</p>

<p>“I’d just like a little fighting,” rejoined Roger.</p>

<p>The wish of the senator’s son was gratified
sooner than any of them expected. They had
reached the line and were busy digging themselves
into temporary quarters, when, with no
warning whatever, came a volley of shots from
a patch of woods some distance ahead.</p>

<p>At the time the volley was delivered the last
gang of the engineers, led by a Lieutenant
Harney, was coming up. The lieutenant was in
the lead, and as the volley rang out he was seen
to throw up his hands and pitch headlong. The
others of the detail dropped down in the grass,
one wounded in the shoulder and another in the
side. The lieutenant had been struck squarely
in the forehead, and was no doubt instantly
killed.</p>

<p>“They are coming this way! The Heinies
are coming this way!”</p>

<p>The report proved true. Encouraged by the
success of their first volley, a company of German
soldiers came crawling forward through the
thick brushwood, sending volley after volley in
the direction of the engineers.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to fight them, boys!” shouted
Captain Obray. “Make every shot tell!”</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken two words before several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
of the engineers began to use their guns.
Then the others caught up their weapons, and a
scattering of shots could be heard all along the
line of the proposed new trench.</p>

<p>The first company of Germans was quickly followed
by a second, and then a third, aggregating
probably four hundred and fifty men. The engineers
numbered about three hundred and sixty,
a considerable number being missing from the
battalion because of wounds, sickness, and various
other reasons.</p>

<p>It was an unequal contest, but the blood of the
fighting engineers was up, especially when they
saw the death of Lieutenant Harney, who was
popular in the command.</p>

<p>Rapid orders came from the major of the battalion,
and Captain Obray told those under him
to move somewhat to the left, where a slight
rise of ground afforded a little better shelter. In
the meantime, word was sent back by the signal
corps operating in that vicinity that the Germans
were making an attack on the engineers, and asking
for reinforcements.</p>

<p>In another five minutes the contest was on in
all its intensity. Volley after volley came from
the Germans, who were attempting to advance
by crawling from rock to rock and from bush to
bush. But the fighting engineers sent over bullet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
for bullet and had the satisfaction of seeing more
than one of the enemy drop to rise no more.</p>

<p>“Gee! this is the hottest fight yet!” gasped
Phil, after the firing had continued for ten or
fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>“If we only had a machine-gun handy we
might do something,” answered Dave.</p>

<p>It was now seen that several additional German
companies were rushing to the scene of the
conflict. Evidently the enemy was massing with
the idea of breaking through on that part of the
front.</p>

<p>“If we can only hold out until we get reinforcements!”
said Dave.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to hold our ground, boys!”
shouted Captain Obray. “Don’t give in an
inch! We’ll have help here before long! Make
every shot count! Show those Huns what you
are made of!”</p>

<p>A cheer went up at these words—a cheer
which was almost drowned out by a volley of
shots from the German company which had just
come up on the double-quick. Then a great yell
arose from the enemy line, and a few minutes
later they leaped up and, firing as they ran, made
straight for the American engineers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>DAVE SHOWS HIS BRAVERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> young readers must understand that it
would be next to impossible to give all the details
of the battle which occurred when the fighting engineers
were attacked first by a battalion of the
Germans and then by a full regiment.</p>

<p>By the command of the major the engineering
battalion gradually withdrew to the protection
of a number of jagged rocks, flanked here and
there by thick brushwood. Here, screening
themselves as much as possible, the Americans
poured forth volley after volley at the Germans,
and over a score of them went down, some never
to rise again.</p>

<p>But the enemy had probably received word
from their air scouts as to the exact number of
the engineers, and with the first battalion augmented
by the remainder of their regiment, they
showed increased courage and recklessness, and
suddenly made a charge forward, shouting like
demons as they came on.</p>

<p>It was certainly a thrilling moment and enough
to make the heart of any soldier quail, however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
brave. Even the most unthinking of the engineers
could see that they were largely outnumbered,
for the German regiment counted up to at
least sixteen hundred men.</p>

<p>Dave, Roger, Phil, and Ben kept close together.
Shadow was not in this contest, having
not yet returned from the field hospital to which
he had been sent after the accident when the big
trees had come down.</p>

<p>When the call had been sent to the rear asking
for reinforcements, word had also been sent up
to the top of the little hill behind them asking
if the battery there could not open on the advancing
Germans. This battery now sent forth
a lively fire; but it soon had to cease because the
Germans were now so close to the Americans
that firing on them would endanger our engineers.</p>

<p>“Give it to ’em hot, boys, but don’t expose
yourselves until you have to!” called Captain
Obray, and the remaining lieutenant repeated
these words and then they were also repeated by
the top sergeant, who had already taken poor
Lieutenant Harney’s place.</p>

<p>Dave, partly screened by a rock and a bit of
brushwood, was handling his rifle as accurately
and rapidly as he could. In the beginning, as
was to be expected, he had been excited and his
hand had trembled a little. But now his nerves
were steadying themselves, and he took deliberate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
aim at one of the Huns before he pulled the
trigger. He saw the man go down, and then
he immediately shot at a second and a third of
the enemy.</p>

<p>Facing such a determined resistance, the Germans
paused for a moment while still half-way to
the line which separated them from the engineers.
This pause worked great havoc, for it gave all
the Americans a chance to continue their fire,
which they did with deadly effect. But then,
urged most strenuously by their officers, who in
some cases did not hesitate to slap their men with
their swords, the Germans came on once more,
firing several more volleys and then dashing in
with their bayonets. At such close quarters it
became practically impossible to continue the contest
with any degree of regularity. It was a
case of every engineer for himself, and at odds
of three or four to one.</p>

<p>The first fellow to come at Dave was a tall,
burly individual who looked as if he might be a
farmhand. He made a vicious jab at our hero,
who sprang aside with a nimbleness acquired by
long practice in the gymnasium and on the football
field at Oak Hall. Then Dave made a
lunge with his own bayonet, and had the satisfaction
of catching the fellow in the thigh. The
German pulled back and made another lunge, but
this time Dave parried the stroke, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
caught the fellow through the shoulder. This
caused the German to stagger back, and suddenly
he dropped his gun and fell headlong on his side.</p>

<p>While this was going on, Roger and the other
engineers were likewise having their hands full.
Seven or eight Germans had appeared in a bunch
and were jabbing right and left with their bayonets,
yelling at the top of their lungs and making
the most ferocious faces. One caught Phil
through the arm, and another sent Roger to his
knees.</p>

<p>This was a perilous position for the senator’s
son, because before he could rise two of the Germans
were on him, each with an upraised bayonet.
But now Ben leaped in on one side, catching one
of the Germans under the chin with his cold
steel. Not wishing to have his throat pierced,
the fellow jerked backward, pitching heavily over
the rocks.</p>

<p>But the other German had already made another
pass at Roger, and that young engineer
would have caught it in the heart had he not
made a quick movement to one side. Then the
German, having missed his footing, fell forward
and as he did so caught the senator’s son by the
throat.</p>

<p>But now Dave was coming on. Why he had
done so, he did not know, but he had turned his
gun around in his hands so that the butt was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
front of him. Using this with all force, he
made a long leap forward, bringing the gun-butt
down directly on the head of the German.
There was a curious little crack, and the man fell
away to one side, unconscious, if not entirely done
for.</p>

<p>After that matters became so exciting that the
young engineers hardly knew what was taking
place. Sometimes they used their bayonets, and
again they swung their rifles around like clubs,
sweeping the air in front of them in wide semicircles.
Occasionally a shot was fired, and Ben
declared afterwards that he saw one German
shoot another.</p>

<p>With one of his most trustworthy officers gone,
Captain Obray had his hands full doing what
he could for his command. The engineers had
already commenced to fall back on the roadway
which they had recently been building, but orders
were to retreat slowly, because reinforcements
would be coming up now in a short while.</p>

<p>Dave had lost his helmet, his shirt was ripped
up his back in several places, and blood was
streaming from a cut on one hand, and a bruise
was on his cheek. Not until some time later did
he realize that the cut on his hand had come from
a glancing bullet.</p>

<p>The engineers had fallen back about fifty yards
when Dave found himself and those under him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
close to where Captain Obray was himself fighting.
The old civil engineer had discharged his
pistol pointblank at one of the Germans, but now
three had surrounded him, two using their bayonets
and the other handling his gun as a club.
The captain was struck on one shoulder, and his
pistol was sent whizzing from his hand. Then
the two Germans with their bayonets stabbed at
the American officer viciously several times.</p>

<p>When the pistol was sent flying from the captain’s
hand it landed almost at Dave’s feet. He
was about six yards away, and without stopping
to think twice he caught up the weapon, aimed it
at the nearest of the Germans, and fired.</p>

<p>As my old readers know, Dave was quite an
accurate shot, not only with a rifle, but also with
a pistol, and on more than one occasion he had
made a rather remarkable record while firing at
a target. His quick aim was accurate, and the
German nearest to him went down, shot through
the side. Then Dave fired the second time, and
the other German was hit in the right arm. The
fellow was just in the act of making another lunge
with his bayonet, this time at Captain Obray’s
throat; but the shot in the arm caused him to let
his weapon drop. Then, of a sudden, he sank
down, for he had already been wounded in the leg
and had been keeping up merely through excitement.
The third German was running away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“Fine work, Porter, fine work!” gasped Captain
Obray, as Dave sprang to his side and returned
the officer’s pistol to him.</p>

<p>“Are you much hurt? Do you want me to
help you to the rear, Captain?” demanded the
young sergeant quickly.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think I want to go to the rear,”
was the answer, in a voice that shook with emotion.
“Porter, I sha’n’t forget this. It was
splendid!” And then the captain turned away,
for there was much for him to do.</p>

<p>Only a few minutes later Dave found himself
again in the thick of the fight. But now a cheer
rent the air, and it became known that a regiment
of American infantry and several machine-guns
were on their way to relieve the engineers,
who, of course, were not supposed to do any regular
fighting.</p>

<p>“Oh, if we can only hold out until they
come!” muttered Dave. He was beginning to
feel the strain and could hardly keep on his feet.</p>

<p>The engineers were now ordered to withdraw
to one side of the road in order to give the infantry
and the machine-guns a chance to come up.
Of course the machine-guns could not be used on
the Germans while they were mixed up with the
Americans, but it was thought they could be
brought into play in case the enemy did any massing
or started to retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>“Hurrah, here they come!”</p>

<p>“Now those Huns will get what is coming to
them!”</p>

<p>“Rush ’em all the way back to the Rhine!”</p>

<p>A company of American infantry was coming
down the rough forest road on the double-quick.
A short distance behind were two other companies,
and then followed a machine-gun detachment.</p>

<p>“Our other men are coming up from the
other side of the hill,” announced the American
officer, who was in command of the newly-arrived
troops. “They’ll be here inside of five minutes,
I believe.”</p>

<p>At first the Germans were rather discomfited
when they saw the American infantry coming up.
But seeing only the three companies and the single
machine-gun detachment, they plucked up
courage again and went at the fight almost as
vigorously as before.</p>

<p>The infantry leaped into the fray with all the
speed at their command, and then the contest became
more bloody every instant. In one place
among some rocks at least fifteen men from each
side fought in such a close space that it was
almost impossible for any of the soldiers to get
elbow room. Several of the men grabbed each
other by the throat, and two of the wounded
were all but trampled to death in the mêlée.</p>

<p>Phil and Roger had both sustained several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
small wounds, but they still kept on fighting, in
spite of the loss of blood which was steadily making
them weaker.</p>

<p>At last the other American troops which were
expected around the lower side of the little hill
burst into view. With them came another machine-gun
detachment and also a company which
was well supplied with hand-grenades. These
grenades they used upon the Germans whenever
they saw an opportunity to do so without injuring
any of their own men.</p>

<p>With a force against them now equal, if not
superior, to their own, the Germans began to
waver, and one company began to fall back, in
spite of the protestations of some of their officers.
Then, as all the Americans made a rush, the remainder
of the enemy commenced to retreat.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, we’ve got ’em on the run!”</p>

<p>“Give it to them good and plenty, boys!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with rounding them up
and making them prisoners?”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk! Let us teach ’em a lesson
they won’t forget!”</p>

<p>So the cries ran on, and while the majority of
the Germans managed to get away from the vicinity
of the Americans, a half-company became
detached from the others, and these were quickly
surrounded.</p>

<p>“Throw up your hands!” cried one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
American officers, and he repeated the words in
German.</p>

<p>A number of the hands went up, and some of
the Germans, realizing that they were out of the
fighting, began to shout, “<i>Kamerad! Kamerad!</i>”
Two, however, of the crowd were ugly, one a
middle-aged soldier and the other a rather young-looking
officer. These two very foolishly raised
their weapons and began shooting, the soldier
with his gun and the young officer with his pistol.
Both of the weapons were discharged twice when
the officer and the private were laid low by bullets
of the Americans. Then the others surrendered
without further question.</p>

<p>Dave was close at hand when the capture was
made of the German soldiers. He heard the
discharge of the pistol and the gun in the hands
of the officer and the private and felt a strange
pain shoot through his body. Then a sudden
faintness seemed to overtake him, and he fell to
the ground senseless.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>IN THE HOSPITAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Well</span>, how are you feeling this morning,
Dave?”</p>

<p>“A great deal better than I did yesterday,
Roger. I think, if all goes well, I’ll be up on my
feet by to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to go slow, so the nurse tells
me. That wound was rather a serious one, even
though it was clean-cut.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I can be thankful that it didn’t go
through my lungs instead of my side,” went on
Dave, with an attempt at a smile. “How are
you feeling, Roger?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m all right again.”</p>

<p>“And how is Phil?”</p>

<p>“Here he comes to speak for himself,” answered
the young corporal.</p>

<p>About two weeks had elapsed since that memorable
day when Dave and the other fighting engineers
had made such a record of bravery for
themselves. Through them the new road
through the forest had been held, and now the
American line in that direction had been advanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
from eight to ten miles. The Germans
in that vicinity were gradually being shoved into
a pocket, and the Allies felt certain that sooner
or later they would break away and begin a general
retreat.</p>

<p>As Dave intimated, the bullet which had prostrated
him had passed through his side not a
great distance from his right lung. It had been
a clean-cut flesh wound, however, and no complications
had followed.</p>

<p>At first Dave had been taken to a temporary
field hospital, but twenty-four hours later he had
been placed in one of the big ambulances along
with a number of others and rushed to a base
hospital some distance back from the lines, and it
was at this place he now rested. He had been
given the best of medical attention, and a Red
Cross nurse saw to it that he had every comfort.</p>

<p>During those days in the hospital our hero had
been visited twice by Captain Obray, who himself
had been slightly wounded in the fray. The captain
was very grateful to Dave for what he had
done, insisting that our hero had saved his life.</p>

<p>“I shall never forget this, Porter, never!”
the captain had said, in a voice filled with emotion.
“And I want everybody to know it—even
your folks at home.”</p>

<p>Many of the engineers had been cited for
special bravery, and at the top of the list was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
Dave’s name, for which, of course, he was pardonably
proud. He had likewise been recommended
for promotion.</p>

<p>“I understand they are going to offer you a
lieutenancy, Dave,” remarked Phil, after he had
come up and greeted his chum.</p>

<p>“A lieutenancy!” exclaimed Dave, his eyes
lighting up with expectancy.</p>

<p>“That’s the talk around camp. And I don’t
know that anybody in our company deserves it
more than you do.”</p>

<p>“Phil is right!” added Roger. “And maybe
it will come pretty quick, too, Dave. Somebody
has got to fill poor Harney’s place.”</p>

<p>“I think you fellows ought to be promoted
yourselves.”</p>

<p>“There has been a little talk of making us sergeants,”
answered Roger. “Of course, we
won’t complain if they insist on shoving us up,”
and he grinned. Even though he was the son
of a United States senator who had made a
great record for himself at Washington, Roger
was as modest as any engineer in the corps.</p>

<p>During the days spent in the base hospital our
hero had received several letters from home, all
of which had given him more or less satisfaction.
First had come a communication from his father,
giving him many particulars of how matters were
going both in business and at home, and stating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
that he and Dave’s Uncle Dunston were once
more active in Liberty Loan work and that Mr.
Wadsworth had doubled his previous subscription
to the loan.</p>

<p>Then had come a brief communication from
his sister Laura, stating that she had heard he
was wounded, but was glad to know that it was
not serious. She added that she was writing a
longer letter to Roger and that Jessie was also
sending him a communication which would probably
tell him all the things he cared most to know.
She added that old Professor Potts had recovered
somewhat from his recent indisposition and
was again around, spending, as before, most of
his time in the Wadsworth library, poring over his
precious volumes.</p>

<p>And then two days later had come the long-looked-for
letter from Jessie. Still weak from
his wounds, Dave’s hands had trembled not a
little when he tore this communication open to
peruse it.</p>

<p>The heart of the girl whom the young engineer
adored was in that letter, and Dave read it over
many times. In it Jessie spoke of the shock she
had received when the casualty lists in the daily
newspapers had contained the information that
Dave had been wounded. Then she told how a
cablegram from Roger had been received, stating
that it was not serious.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“You cannot imagine, dear Dave, how much
relieved we were to receive that cablegram,”
Jessie continued. “We had not slept at all during
the night. It was dreadful to think that you
had been shot down by those awful Germans.
Oh, Dave, when you get around again do be careful!
If anything happened to you I do not know
what I would do. I don’t think I would care to
live any longer.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Dear, dear Jessie!” murmured Dave, as he
read this paragraph several times. “The best
girl that ever lived!”</p>

<p>Jessie then went on to relate about how she
had missed some letters from Dave which had
since arrived in a bunch, and she added that she
herself had forwarded several letters to him
which for some reason he could not have received.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After this I am going to number the letters,”
she added; “so you will know exactly what is
missing, if any.</p>

<p>“Of course you have seen Laura’s letters to
Roger, so you know all about the success of our
entertainments here for the local charities. Although
it called for a good deal of hard work,
there was not a little fun attached to it, too, and I
am sure we all enjoyed it. There was only one
cloud for me, Dave; and now that it has passed I
hardly think it is worth mentioning. Still, as
some day or other you may meet Lieutenant Gebauer,
or possibly Nat Poole, who knows of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
occurred, perhaps it would be best for me to let
you know just how things stand.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Gebauer, as you are aware, is connected
with the Gebauer jewelry concern of Philadelphia,
and he and Papa transact quite a good
deal of business. He often visits Crumville, and
when Papa heard he had joined the army and got
a commission, he was so pleased that he asked
Gebauer to our house.</p>

<p>“From that time on the lieutenant—for what
reason I know not, because I gave him no encouragement—became
very attentive to me. He, of
course, knew how matters stood between you and
me, but that seemed to have no effect on him. He
insisted upon pressing his attentions on me, until
I was forced to give him the cold shoulder.
Through Papa he gave me a very handsome Red
Cross pin, one which their concern has something
to do with manufacturing. But I am not going
to wear it. I have a pin which I purchased myself.
He was quite put out when I finally
dropped him, and went off in anything but a good
humor.</p>

<p>“During his stay here in Crumville in some manner
or other he became acquainted with the Pooles;
and when Nat was home on leave of absence from
the training camp the two became quite chummy.
Both of them are now in France, and it is possible
that you may meet them, and for that reason,
as I said before, I think you ought to know
how matters stand. Lieutenant Gebauer may try
to make you believe that we are very friendly,
but it is not true. I simply tolerated him because
I didn’t wish to do anything which might interfere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
with Papa’s business connections with the Philadelphia
concern.”</p>
</div>

<p>There was more of this, Jessie going into some
of the details of what had taken place between
her and the lieutenant during the entertainments
and for a week or two following. She did not
say outright, but Dave could read between the
lines, and he felt certain that Max Gebauer had
in the end made himself quite obnoxious, even
though outwardly he had acted the part of a gentleman.</p>

<p>“He must be a regular pill,” was Dave’s
mental comment, as he put the letter away. “If
he’s that sort, he’d better not come around where
I am. He certainly can’t amount to much if he
trains with such a chap as Nat Poole.”</p>

<p>Dave was quite curious to know whether Lieutenant
Gebauer and Nat Poole had really come
over to France. But there was no way of finding
out. He questioned a number with whom he
came in contact, who had been at various American
camps throughout France, but not one could
give him a word concerning the pair.</p>

<p>During those days came another cause for
gratitude. Buster Beggs had recovered from
the gas attack which had laid him low, and had
once more joined the engineers at the front.
His eyes were a trifle weak as yet, and he had to
be careful of what he ate for fear of getting sick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
at the stomach, but otherwise he was as well as
ever. Shadow was also around again.</p>

<p>It was a great day for Dave when he was allowed
to get up and put on his clothes once more
and go out into the sunshine. He felt quite
shaky, and he was glad enough to rest after walking
but a short distance. The base hospital had
once been a château, and in the garden was a
beautiful fountain surrounded by flowers, and
here the convalescent soldiers gathered on
benches to regain their health and to talk over
the war.</p>

<p>“I think the war will end in another three or
four months,” said one of the convalescents.</p>

<p>“That’s right; they must be pretty close to the
end of their resources,” put in another.</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe that, Jack,” came from
a third. “They must have been close to the end
of their resources before, but now you must remember
they are plundering the Russians of everything
of use in that country. They’ll be
able to get immense quantities of food and war
material that were meant for the Russian army,
and that will keep them going for a long while.”</p>

<p>“The collapse of Russia will undoubtedly
help the Germans to continue the conflict,” said
Dave. “But I believe that sooner or later
they’ll have to give in. They must know that
they cannot stand against all of us combined.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“I’ll tell you where we have got them,” said
another of the convalescents, a marine who had
seen some fierce fighting ever since the Americans
had entered the contest. “The Heinies can
fight well enough while they are in a bunch, but
as soon as you separate them they become next
to helpless. Their individual soldiers don’t seem
to have any initiative. Now with our men it’s
just the opposite. They’ll fight well enough together,
but let them get separated, and each man
is on his mettle to do the very best he knows how
and make a record for himself.”</p>

<p>“You are right there,” replied Dave. “And
that puts me in mind of a story I heard only yesterday.
A Western cowboy, who knew all
about rounding up cattle but very little about
army life, was in one of the advances and all at
once became separated from the rest of his command.
He wandered around until he came to
a trench, and then found a dugout containing
some German soldiers.</p>

<p>“Now it seems this cowboy had been on
kitchen duty for his company some days before,
and as he didn’t like peeling potatoes and doing
stunts like that he was very much out of humor.
He pointed his gun at the dugout and yelled to
the Germans to come out. One of them held
up his hands and managed to ask in broken English
what was wanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“‘You come out of that or I’ll fire this hand-grenade
at you!’ yelled the cowboy, and flourished
something in his hand.</p>

<p>“The Germans became very much frightened,
and one after another came out of the dugout
and lined up, hands in the air. There were five
of them, and the cowboy motioned to them to
march with their hands up in the direction of
the American line. Once or twice the Germans
balked, but every time they did this the cowboy
made a swing with his hand as if to throw a
grenade at them.</p>

<p>“Finally they got near the American lines and
some other soldiers came out to see what was
doing.</p>

<p>“‘I’ve got five of the Heinies here,’ announced
the cowboy calmly. ‘And it only took
this baked potato to bring ’em in,’ and then he
showed the supposed hand-grenade, which was
only a common potato which he had kept as a
memento of his hours in the camp kitchen.”</p>

<p>“Some potato!” cried one of the listeners.</p>

<p>“That was sure a raw deal,” said another
laughing.</p>

<p>“No raw deal at all—the potato was baked,”
answered Dave, with a grin, and at this there
was another laugh.</p>

<p>A few days later Dave was getting ready to
leave the hospital. Once on his feet, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
strength had returned rapidly, and he now insisted
that he be allowed to return to his command.</p>

<p>“You are certainly a plucky soldier,” remarked
the Red Cross nurse who had been taking
care of him. “Not many of the boys are
as anxious to leave as you are.”</p>

<p>Dave was sitting on a bench waiting for the
lorry which was to take him and a number of others
back to the front, when an ambulance came
up with some wounded. Three were on stretchers,
but others were able to get out themselves
and walk into the hospital.</p>

<p>“Dave Porter!”</p>

<p>The cry came from one of the soldiers who
had descended from the ambulance, a fellow in
the regulation khaki and with his left hand done
up in a sling. Our hero stared at the new arrival
in amazement.</p>

<p>It was Nat Poole!</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>WHAT NAT POOLE SAID</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Why</span>, Nat Poole! what brings you here?”
exclaimed Dave, as he moved forward to meet
the young fellow from Crumville. The fact that
Nat was in uniform and had his left hand done
up in a sling made our hero for the time being
forget his antagonism to the slacker who had
never been a friend.</p>

<p>“Oh, I got my wrist sprained—I don’t know
but that it’s broken,” replied the son of the well-known
money lender of Crumville. He turned
anything but a pleasant face to Dave. “What
are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I got wounded in one of the little musses
we had with the Germans.”</p>

<p>“Wounded? I didn’t know you engineers
got into any fighting. I thought your job was a
soft snap well behind the lines,” returned Nat
Poole.</p>

<p>“We have had more or less fighting to do
ever since we came over,” returned the young
sergeant. “Even when we were at the front
with the Canadians the Germans tried to rush<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
us two or three times, and blew up one of the
bridges we were building.”</p>

<p>“Was it much of a wound?” went on Nat
curiously.</p>

<p>“I got a bullet through my side and another
one grazed the back of my hand”; and Dave
exhibited the scar left by the latter hurt. “I’ve
been at the hospital for several weeks. I’m just
getting ready to leave now.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say! Where are you going—home?”</p>

<p>“Home! Not much! I’m going to the
front again just as fast as I can get there.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you were wounded as bad as you
say they ought to give you a chance to go home
and rest up,” continued the money lender’s son.</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to go home, Nat. I want
to go to the front and stay there until this war
is over and we have licked the Heinies out of
their boots!” cried Dave. “Why, I wouldn’t
miss the fun for anything!”</p>

<p>“You must be a queer sort, Dave Porter, to
consider being shot fun,” grumbled Nat. “I
guess you weren’t hurt much. Maybe you only
got a scratch or two and wanted to show off,”
he added, with a touch of old-time envy in his
voice. At Oak Hall, Nat Poole had always envied
Dave his popularity and had done everything
in his power to depreciate it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“Well, all I can tell you about the wound
in my side is what the doctors and nurses here
have said,” returned our hero calmly. “They
all think I ought to stay in the hospital a little
longer. They say they never heard of a fellow
getting up so quickly and starting back for the
front. But I’m tired of staying here doing nothing.
I want to get with the rest of the bunch
and see what is going on.</p>

<p>“But tell me about yourself, Nat,” continued
Dave kindly. “Were you in a fight?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was!” replied the other sourly.</p>

<p>“What, with the Huns?” questioned Dave
incredulously. He could not understand how the
money lender’s son had been able to get to the
fighting front so quickly.</p>

<p>“No, it wasn’t at the front,” growled Nat.
“I got into a row with our company cook. He
served us some chow that wasn’t fit for a dog
to touch. I laid him out good and proper, and
he hit me with a frying-pan. He had no right
to do it, and I reported him.”</p>

<p>“And was it the frying-pan that knocked out
your wrist?” queried Dave, and now he had all
he could do to keep from grinning in Nat’s face.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was. And it pained awfully at first.
I used my first-aid kit, but it didn’t seem to
do any good, and so I asked for permission to
come up here to the hospital and have the wrist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
examined. I want it attended to properly, too!
I don’t want any two-cent army doctor mussing
with it. I don’t intend to go through life with
a stiff wrist, or a crooked one, either. Do you
suppose they’ve got any really good doctors at
this place?”</p>

<p>“There are several surgeons here who are
just as good as you’ll find anywhere, Nat. And
the nurses and the nursing couldn’t be better.
Then you came over on your own account?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I got permission, of course.”</p>

<p>“Is the camp you are at in this vicinity?”</p>

<p>“It’s about two miles from here. Say, take
me in and show me where to go. This wrist of
mine is beginning to hurt again,” went on Nat
Poole.</p>

<p>Had it been anybody but the money lender’s
son, Dave might have felt more sympathy for
him. But as it was, he knew that when Nat
was hurt he was inclined to make a mountain
out of a molehill.</p>

<p>Though Dave aided as much as he could, the
money lender’s son had to wait until the more
serious cases had been disposed of by the surgeons
in attendance. Then a rather elderly man,
the same who had attended Dave, took hold of
Nat.</p>

<p>“I can’t find any bones broken,” said the
surgeon, after a careful examination. “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
wrist is bruised a little and probably feels somewhat
lame. We’ll put some liniment on it and
bind it up well, and I think you will find it as
well as ever in a day or two.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think I’d better stay at the hospital
for a few days and make sure of it?” questioned
Nat, eagerly.</p>

<p>“What! Stay? Not at all! This place
is only for those who are more or less seriously
wounded. That isn’t a hospital case
at all. In fact, I can hardly understand why you
took the trouble to come here to have it attended
to. Many of the men get hurts much worse
than that and say nothing about them;” and
then the surgeon turned his back on Nat to show
that the interview was at an end. Evidently he
had met such slackers as the money lender’s
son before and knew exactly how to handle
them.</p>

<p>“I knew just how it would be,” growled Nat,
as he walked out, followed by Dave. “As long
as there isn’t any extra money in it for them they
don’t care how they treat a fellow! I know how
my wrist hurts, even if he doesn’t. I’ll go back
to camp and take care of it myself. But I am
not going on duty yet awhile, and I’ll tell the
top sergeant so. By the way, I see you are a
sergeant.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“It’s funny how some fellows just tumble into
luck,” went on Nat, more sourly than ever. “I
came pretty near becoming a sergeant myself,
but a big bruiser of a fellow from up the State
did me out of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll have a good chance to work your
way up, Nat, now you are over in France. They
are promoting fellows every day for duties well
done and for bravery under fire.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I know all about that. Those
who are in favor with the fellows higher up get
all the plums, and the rest of the poor dubs can
whistle.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that at all, Nat. I’ve been
over here now since the middle of last summer,
and so far as I can see, promotions have been
only according to merit. Of course, here and
there a person who doesn’t particularly deserve
it may get ahead, but that is the exception to the
rule. Most of the men who have gotten honors
have well deserved them.”</p>

<p>“Humph! you’ll never make me believe that,
Dave Porter. I know too much about such
things. I know that money talks, for one thing.
I think I might have had a lieutenancy if my
old man would only have shelled out enough
money. But you know how tight he is—just as
tight as the bark on a tree.”</p>

<p>“What did he say when you were drafted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
Nat?” questioned Dave, with pardonable curiosity.</p>

<p>“What did he say? What could he say? I
was drafted, and that was all there was to it.
You knew my sentiments when you were in Crumville.
Didn’t you break up one of my peace
meetings—a meeting I had a perfect right to
hold?”</p>

<p>“I deny that you had a right to hold that
meeting, Nat. However, all of that is now
past and gone. You’re in the army, and it is
your duty to do the best you can for Uncle Sam.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll do my duty—don’t you fear about
that, Dave Porter. I’m just as patriotic as anybody.
But, at the same time, I claim I have a
right to be patriotic in my own way.”</p>

<p>“Well, you let me give you a little advice,
Nat,” was Dave’s earnest comment. “The fellows
over here in France are rather serious-minded,
and they won’t stand for any nonsense.
If they get the least intimation that you are any
kind of a slacker, they’ll come down on you like
a ton of bricks.”</p>

<p>“I don’t need your advice!”</p>

<p>“Very well then, Nat; I won’t say another
word.”</p>

<p>“You think just because you’ve been over here
a year or so and they have made you a sergeant
that you know everything. I haven’t forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
how you tried to run things at Oak Hall. Of
course, some of the fellows toadied to you, but
if you’ll remember, I wasn’t in that crowd.”</p>

<p>“Now, Nat, don’t get so hot under the collar.
It won’t get you anywhere. We’re both over
here to do our duty, so what is the use of quarreling?
I was going to ask you about some of
the folks at home and how Crumville looked and
all that; and I thought maybe you would like to
know something about Ben Basswood and the
other fellows you know who are over here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to know anything about Ben
Basswood or any of the others of the bunch who
are under your thumb. I’m with a crowd that
suits me a great deal better than that Oak Hall
bunch ever did. But I’ll tell you one thing, Dave
Porter,” went on Nat suddenly. “There is one
fellow in our command that you had better keep
your eyes open for.”</p>

<p>“And who is that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll find out soon enough—that is, if
you ever get any real news from Crumville,”
answered the money lender’s son insinuatingly.</p>

<p>“Then you don’t want to tell me?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you want to know so bad, it’s Lieutenant
Max Gebauer, the son of that millionaire
jewelry manufacturer of Philadelphia,” went on
Nat triumphantly. “You know their firm and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
the Wadsworth concern have a whole lot of business
dealings.”</p>

<p>“Well, what has Lieutenant Gebauer and those
business dealings to do with me?” questioned our
hero, although he knew about what was coming.</p>

<p>“I guess you thought you had it all settled
with Jessie Wadsworth and had it all fixed just
how you were going to tie fast to the Wadsworth
fortune,” continued Nat. “Well, maybe you’ll
have another guess coming. I don’t imagine
Jessie Wadsworth thinks as much of you as you
think she does.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you had better let Jessie drop,
Nat? Our feelings for each other are our own,
not yours.” And Dave’s voice grew a trifle cold.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course! And I don’t intend to butt
in. I never cared for her, and you know it.
She’s an only daughter, and thoroughly spoiled.”
Nat did not seem to realize that he was an only
son and over-indulged. “Just the same, I think
Lieutenant Gebauer has got the upper hand of
you. He helped her at some charity exhibitions,
and took her out riding, and to one of the dances,
and I don’t know what all. He’s been calling on
her right along, and the rumor is around Crumville
that they are secretly engaged.”</p>

<p>“Nat, you’re making that so-called rumor up
yourself!” cried Dave. “I know all about how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Max Gebauer has been calling on Jessie and how
he forced his attentions on her. She herself has
written to me about it, if you must know. I
don’t give that fellow any credit for what he has
done. But now that he is in France and she is
done with him, why not let the whole matter
drop?”</p>

<p>“Oh, so she wrote to you about him, did she?
Well, maybe she told the truth and maybe she
didn’t. Oh, now don’t get too hot!” cried Nat
hastily, as Dave’s eyes suddenly flashed fire and
he clenched his fists. “I’m only telling you about
things that I saw with my own eyes. I know that
she went out with him a great deal and that she
seemed to like his company. And whether you
want to believe it or not, there is a rumor that
they are secretly engaged and that they are to
announce the engagement publicly as soon as she
can get some sort of a decent pretext for breaking
off her engagement with you. That’s all I’ve
got to say.”</p>

<p>And having thus delivered himself, Nat Poole
turned to where a motor-lorry bound for his camp
was standing, and a few minutes later was off,
leaving Dave in a much disturbed frame of mind
staring after him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>THE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE MEDAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> hour later found Dave on a heavy motor-lorry
bound for the place to which the fighting engineers
had moved after the thrilling fight on the
new roadway through the forest. Our hero had
been told by one of the hospital staff that the
lorry was headed that way, and the driver, a
young American college man, had readily consented
to give him a lift.</p>

<p>The drive to the engineers’ camp took about
two hours. For the greater part it was over
roadways much torn up by shell-fire and being
used by a steady stream of lorries and other
turnouts coming and going. On the way they
met a battery which was shifting its position, and
also a regiment of soldiers who were swinging
along whistling popular tunes. They likewise
passed a number of French people, most of them
carrying some of their worldly possessions on their
backs or under their arms. All of them looked
much downcast, as if they had lost their last friend
on earth, yet when they met the eyes of the Americans
they would smile hopefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“They’re looking to our boys to do a whole
lot for them,” said the lorry driver to Dave.</p>

<p>“And we’re going to make good!” answered
our hero promptly. “Those folks are all going
to have their homes back again.”</p>

<p>At the time Dave returned to camp the engineers
had finished one piece of work and were
awaiting orders. As soon as he leaped from the
lorry there was a rush to greet him.</p>

<p>“Here’s Dave!”</p>

<p>“How are you, old man?”</p>

<p>“How did they treat you at the hospital?”</p>

<p>“Say, but you’re looking fine! It must pay to
get wounded.”</p>

<p>“It hasn’t been the same old camp since you
went away, Dave. My, but we’re glad to see
you back!” And Roger, who had thus spoken,
grabbed him by both hands. Then the others
surrounded our hero, and while one caught a
hand another caught him around the shoulders
and another around the waist.</p>

<p>“Hay, let up, you fellows!” cried the young
sergeant good-naturedly. “Please don’t pull me
apart. Remember I have just come from the
hospital.”</p>

<p>“That’s right! Boys, be careful,” admonished
Phil. “We don’t want to kill him with kindness.”</p>

<p>“Say, that puts me in mind of a story,” burst
out Shadow, who had been the one to encircle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Dave’s waist. “A ragged newsboy went to a
charity picnic. One of the ladies kept on stuffing
him with cake. Finally she said: ‘Oh, Johnny,
do have another piece of cake.’ Then Johnny
turned a woebegone face on her and replied:
‘Thank yer, Miss. I could chaw it fur yer, but
I couldn’t swaller it.’”</p>

<p>“We’ve got no time to listen to stories—only
the one that Dave has to tell,” burst out Ben.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you in service again, Buster!”
exclaimed Dave, as he caught the stout youth by
the hand.</p>

<p>“We’ve both been through it, haven’t we,
Dave?” was Buster’s reply, with a grin.</p>

<p>“Here is where the Oak Hall boys celebrate!”
cried Roger.</p>

<p>“You’ve said it!” responded Phil. “And
thank fortune we’ve got something to celebrate
on,” he added.</p>

<p>“Phil and I went back to the nearest French
town yesterday,” explained Ben. “We took up
a collection and came back with a whole lot of
good things to eat. We thought you would be
along soon, from the word you sent two days
ago.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine!” replied Dave, his eyes beaming.
It warmed his heart to think of how his
chums had remembered him. “Oak Hall forever!”
he exclaimed enthusiastically. And then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
he added, making a sudden wry face: “Although
I know one fellow who won’t subscribe
to that sentiment.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Show him to me, and I’ll pound the life out of
him!”</p>

<p>“He must be some dirty sneak!”</p>

<p>“The fellow I mean is Nat Poole,” answered
Dave, and then came another outburst.</p>

<p>“Where did you meet that slacker?”</p>

<p>“Did they really make him come over to France
after all?”</p>

<p>“Do you really mean to say you met Nat
Poole?” demanded Roger.</p>

<p>“Yes. At the hospital where I was staying—just
before I came away.” And then our hero
gave some of the particulars. He did not at
that time mention Lieutenant Max Gebauer except
in a general way, for he did not wish to
drag Jessie’s name into the discussion which he
knew would follow.</p>

<p>“Gee, but that’s rich—Nat Poole getting
whacked over the wrist with a frying-pan!”
chuckled Phil. “I wish I had been there to see
it.”</p>

<p>“And fancy Nat pitching into the cook for
having done it!” said Buster. “I suppose he
went up and shook his forefinger in the cook’s
face and said: ‘You naughty boy! You are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
real rude, don’t you know!’” he mimicked, and
at this there was a roar of laughter.</p>

<p>“Well, there is one thing certain,” remarked
Ben. “The army will either make a man of Nat
or he’ll be about half-killed, even if he doesn’t
get shot.”</p>

<p>“Fancy Nat’s wanting to be an officer!” broke
in Phil.</p>

<p>“I must say I am mighty thankful for one
thing,” announced our hero. “And that is that
Nat didn’t attempt to join the engineers. I would
consider it an awful hardship to have him around
all the time.”</p>

<p>“You never said anything truer than that,
Dave,” returned Ben.</p>

<p>That night there was quite a celebration in one
corner of the large dugout where the company
to which Dave belonged was quartered. All the
good things purchased by Phil and Ben in the
neighboring French town were brought forth, and
it may be surmised that all the young engineers
did full justice to the “eats” set before them.</p>

<p>“This is almost like one of our old feasts at
Oak Hall,” was Dave’s comment.</p>

<p>“Only we haven’t got Big Jim Murphy to
watch us,” said Buster.</p>

<p>“Good-hearted Jim!” cried Dave. “He sure
did do us many a good turn. I wonder where he
is now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“Somebody told me he was in the heavy artillery,
along with Luke Watson,” answered Shadow.</p>

<p>“Speaking of the old Oak Hall boys, what
has become of Polly Vane?” queried Ben, referring
to a youth of high intellectuality who,
because of his girlish appearance, had been nicknamed
Polly.</p>

<p>“Polly is at the head of one of the big government
offices in Washington,” answered Roger.
“I found that out through my dad, who chanced
to meet him there one day while on business.
Polly, he told me, is doing unusually well. It’s
something connected with the war department,
so you can say that he is really in the war, too,
even though he isn’t on the firing-line.”</p>

<p>It was not until the next day, when Dave could
catch Roger alone, that he told his chum of what
Nat Poole had said concerning Lieutenant Max
Gebauer. This brought on quite a talk, during
which the senator’s son told of what Laura had
written on the subject of the young lieutenant.</p>

<p>“I always wanted to say something about that
to you, Dave,” said Roger; “but somehow I
couldn’t bring myself to do it. I spoke to Phil
about it, and we concluded that it would do no
good to worry you. I am mighty glad that the
matter is cleared up so far as you and Jessie are
concerned, and I know that Phil will be mighty
glad, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“I understand your feelings perfectly, Roger.
Just the same, I think you should have come to
me in the first place. However, that is now a
thing of the past. What worries me is what Nat
Poole said about a rumor going around Crumville
concerning Jessie and this lieutenant. If
this gets to Jessie’s ears, it will certainly hurt
her feelings terribly.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt that.”</p>

<p>“Maybe when she sent Gebauer off about his
business he got miffed and spread the report himself,
just to get square with her. And for all
I know, Nat Poole may have had a hand in it,
too.”</p>

<p>“If he did he ought to have a good pounding
for it!” The senator’s son thought for a moment.
“I’ll tell you what I can do, Dave. I can
write to Laura and tell her what Nat Poole said,
and then she and Jessie can fix up some scheme
whereby they can let folks in Crumville know that
there is nothing in the rumor.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that might help some,” and Dave’s face
brightened a little. A letter was written that very
night by the senator’s son and posted without
delay.</p>

<p>Captain Obray was glad to see Dave back again,
and praised him once more for what he had done.</p>

<p>“As you know, Sergeant Porter, you have already
been cited for bravery for what you did for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
me and others during that battle,” said the captain
of the engineers. “In a few days I hope
to be able to announce something that will, I am
sure, please you very much.”</p>

<p>Two days later came the announcement, which
filled Dave with great pleasure. The engineers
were reviewed by one of the army generals, and
Dave, with a number of others, was asked to
step forward, and then upon the breast of the
young sergeant was pinned a Distinguished Service
Medal—a round bronze disk bearing upon it an
American eagle. The disk rested on a ribbon having
a white center with a narrow blue stripe on
each side and with red stripes at the ends. It
may be mentioned here that the Distinguished
Service Medals are authorized by our President
for distinguished services in the present war.</p>

<p>“Dave, we’ve got to congratulate you,” said
Roger warmly, after the review had come to an
end and he and some of the other engineers had
come around to gaze at the medal and admire it.
“That is something you can wear for the rest
of your life with a great deal of pride.”</p>

<p>“I’m hoping to see each of you fellows get one
of these before the war is over,” answered the
young sergeant. “I don’t know but what some
of you deserve them already.”</p>

</figure>

<p>“We’re not all as quick-witted as you are,
Dave,” remarked Buster. “We may be willing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
enough to do a thing, but while we are thinking
about it you jump in and do it.”</p>

<p>“You’ve said it, Buster,” added Shadow. “It’s
the quick-thinking and quick-acting fellow who is
going to get in the lead in this war, every time.”</p>

<p>Shadow and Phil had something to tell Dave
which further interested the young sergeant.
This was to the effect that they had had a chance
some time before to visit the place where Dave
had once located a hidden German ammunition
dump. The two young engineers had made a
long search in that vicinity for Dave’s missing
watch. They had found the wrist-band to which
the timepiece had been attached, but the watch
itself had been missing.</p>

<p>“Well, that proves one thing,” said Dave.
“I certainly lost the watch in that vicinity. And
if it wasn’t in the band it must have either been
smashed by the explosion or otherwise some person
must have picked it up.”</p>

<p>Of course Dave had to write home concerning his
medal, and he took the occasion to send a long
communication to Jessie, mentioning what Nat
Poole had told him concerning Gebauer. He
added that he hoped the girl would not suffer
because of any rumor that might have been circulated
in their home town.</p>

<p>“Well, we have orders to get on the march
again to-morrow morning,” announced one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
sergeants to Dave two days later, following a
quiet Sunday, which Dave had spent in resting and
in attending services at a nearby Y. M. C. A. hut.
At the services he had listened to a good, straightforward
sermon on the duties of a soldier, and
there had followed a number of the familiar religious
songs in which the entire congregation of
engineers and others had joined heartily.</p>

<p>“I suppose we’re going up to the front again?”
remarked Dave.</p>

<p>“More than likely. Although I haven’t any
very definite information.”</p>

<p>“Did they say whether it would be trench work
or road work?”</p>

<p>“Trench work, I imagine; although I’m not
sure.”</p>

<p>Two days after that found the fighting engineers
in a place that was entirely new to them.
Here a long line of trenches were under construction
by some other engineers, and they were sent
in to give assistance before opening up a roadway
still further to the northeast.</p>

<p>The weather had been fairly good for some
time, but now another storm set in which made
trench-digging anything but pleasant. However,
it was all a part of the game, as Dave remarked,
and consequently he did not complain. He wore
his high trench boots and his rubber slicker, and
thus protected himself as best he could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>A large part of the trench work in that vicinity
had been completed before the fighting engineers
arrived on the scene. They, however, were set
to work completing the interior of a dugout of
large proportions, a place located fully forty feet
underground and covered with the trunks of
many trees.</p>

<p>“This certainly ought to be a safe place from
any bombardment,” remarked Phil, while they
were at work.</p>

<p>Sixteen of the engineers were still down in the
dugout, the others having been ordered to the
surface, when there came a cry of alarm from a
distance. Immediately following the cry came a
roar of artillery, and this was kept up for fully
a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>“Something is doing—that’s sure!” cried
Dave. “I wonder if it is possible that a battle
is developing in this vicinity?”</p>

<p>“It certainly sounds like it,” answered Ben.
“And it sounds to me as if it was coming nearer
every minute.”</p>

<p>“If it comes this way, maybe we’ll be in for
another fight!” cried Roger.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>THE MACHINE-GUN NESTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> Huns are coming, boys!”</p>

<p>“Up and at ’em, fellows! Don’t give Jerry
a chance to get anywhere near us!”</p>

<p>So the cries ran up and down the trenches,
mingled with several orders and the cracking of
rifles. Then the artillery, which had ceased for
a moment, began again, this time with increased
fury.</p>

<p>“I think we had better get out of here, boys,”
announced Dave. “Never mind your tools. I
guess all you’ll want just now will be your rifles.
We’ll go as far as the entrance to the dugout,
anyway.”</p>

<p>As the dugout and the entrance to it were not
yet completed, it was no easy task to crawl up the
wet and slippery slope leading to the trenches.</p>

<p>As requested by him, the top sergeant of the
company had been transferred to another unit, and
as Dave was next in rank to him, and as
no one had been as yet appointed to fill poor
Lieutenant Harney’s place, Dave was in command
of the engineers left in the dugout.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that he felt his responsibility,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
the more so because the sudden alarm above
had cut him off from communication with the
first lieutenant or the captain. Some of the engineers
attached to the signal corps had been stringing
telephone wires along the trench to the dugout,
but these were as yet not ready to be used.</p>

<p>As the engineers came up to the level of the
trench above them they saw some fierce fighting
not a great distance away. A fairly large body
of German troops had come forward over a slight
rise of ground and had taken a position behind
a natural ridge of rocks. Off to one side a German
machine-gun nest had been located, and from
this the enemy was pouring a constant fire toward
the Americans.</p>

<p>“We’re in for it, all right enough!” cried
Roger.</p>

<p>“Boys, when you use your guns make every
shot tell!” cried Dave to his little command.
And then, of a sudden, he turned to face the
crowd. “Are you with me in trying to do a bit
of hazardous work that may count big for our
side?” he questioned quickly.</p>

<p>“Sure we are!” cried Phil.</p>

<p>“You can count on me every time, Dave! You
know that,” announced Roger.</p>

<p>“Show us what we can do, and we’ll do it,”
was the way Ben expressed himself. And the
others shouted various words of approval.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>A few military supplies had been brought down
into the dugout by some soldiers who had been
ordered to leave them there for the present.
Among these supplies Dave had noticed a box
of hand-grenades. He immediately ordered two
of his men to go below and bring the box up with
all possible speed.</p>

<p>“I am not quite sure whether we can reach that
machine-gun nest with these hand-grenades or
not,” he said; “but, anyway, I think it’s worth
trying.”</p>

<p>“We can’t throw them from here,” said Phil.</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to throw them from here. I’ll
show you what I have in mind just as soon as
the grenades have been distributed.”</p>

<p>It was an easy matter to break open the box
and hand the grenades around. Each man was
supplied with four to six of the deadly explosives.
Then Dave, after another careful survey of the
machine-gun nest, ordered his men to follow him.</p>

<p>On arriving in that locality the young sergeant
had taken time to look over the ground carefully,
noting the various trenches which were in the
course of construction. In doing this he had taken
note also of the lay of the land and had wondered
what would happen if an approach should be made
by the enemy through a little rocky gully running
off to one side and which was all but hidden by
some stunted undergrowth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>This gully, he had now noted with satisfaction,
ran in an irregular way toward the vicinity of the
nest where the German machine-gunners were
operating their weapon with such telling effect
against the Americans. At one point where the
gully made a sharp turn it was less than fifty
yards distant from the gun.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’ll need more than three or
four men,” announced Dave presently. “Who
wants to go along?”</p>

<p>Every engineer wanted that honor, and all
begged Dave not to leave them behind.</p>

<p>“All right—you can all come along if you
want to,” he announced, with a grin. “We’ll
give the Heinies a salute they will most likely never
forget.”</p>

<p>The young sergeant led the way along the
trench to where there was an unfinished portion,
and there he halted his little party and instructed
them carefully.</p>

<p>“Just beyond the top of this trench at a distance
of about ten feet is the beginning of a gully
which runs along between the rocks and bushes
for a long distance. It is very irregular in shape,
and in some places is much deeper than at others.
We’ll have to crawl along slowly and do our best
to keep ourselves hidden. Otherwise the Huns
may spot us, and then it will be all over. Keep
your guns ready for use in case any of the Heinies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
show themselves. They may be in the gully already.”</p>

<p>With caution he raised his helmet on top of his
rifle and held it above the top of the trench. No
rifle report followed, and he moved the helmet
along a distance of several feet, as if the man wearing
it were walking. But no shot came, and then
without further delay he crawled quickly over the
top of the trench and made for the entrance to the
gully he had mentioned. Like so many snakes the
other engineers wriggled along after him.</p>

<p>It took fully a minute for the whole sixteen
to reach the gully, and during that time each man
was fearful that the Germans would discover and
open fire upon them. But the battle was raging
furiously at some distance, and they fortunately
were not noticed.</p>

<p>Once in the gully, they proceeded with caution.
Dave was in the lead, with Roger next and Phil
and the others following. All crawled along on
their arms and knees, holding their rifles ready
for instant use.</p>

<p>Presently Dave heard a sound ahead which
brought him instantly to a halt. It was the noise
of a loose stone falling on a rock, and there followed
an exclamation of pain in German. Evidently
the stone had come down on somebody in
that part of the gully just ahead.</p>

<p>The young sergeant motioned for those behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
him to keep absolutely quiet. Then, with his gun
ready for immediate use, he moved forward inch
by inch until he could peer around a turn in the
gully.</p>

<p>A German soldier was there, sitting on a rock
with his back toward our hero. In one hand he
had a sandwich, consisting of rye bread and a
sausage, and the other a small bottle of native
wine, and he was evidently enjoying his lunch
regardless of the battle going on all around him.
Dave looked beyond the German and saw that he
was alone.</p>

<p>It would have been an easy matter for the young
sergeant to have killed this enemy then and there;
but he could not bring himself thus to shoot a
fellow human being in the back, and besides he
did not consider it good policy to make any unnecessary
noise in the gully. The success of the
task he had undertaken lay, largely, he felt certain,
in advancing in utter silence.</p>

<p>He motioned to Phil and Roger, and both understood.
Then all three advanced side by side
and laid down their rifles.</p>

<p>The next instant Dave was on the German and
with both hands had caught him directly over the
mouth, pulling him backward. Then Roger and
Phil leaped forward, one to kneel on the fellow’s
breast and the other to catch him by the legs.</p>

<p>The German was taken completely by surprise,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
and with his mouth full of bread and sausage he
came close to choking. He spluttered and gasped,
and then, seeing he was helpless in the hands of
the Americans, gasped out hoarsely: “<i>Kamerad!
Kamerad!</i>”</p>

<p>“All right, ‘<i>kamerad</i>’ it is!” announced Dave
in a whisper. “But you keep quiet.” And to
make the fellow understand he pointed to his
mouth and placed his hand over that organ of
speech.</p>

<p>The fellow understood and nodded. His gun
had rested across his lap, so he was easily disarmed.
Then Dave detailed two of the engineers
to take the fellow back to the American
lines.</p>

<p>“And don’t let him make any noise while he
is in this gully,” cautioned the young sergeant.</p>

<p>“You bet your boots he’ll never let out more
than one peep!” announced one of the engineers
who was to take the prisoner back. And, looking
at the prisoner, he pointed to the fellow’s mouth
and then to the point of his own bayonet, to
intimate that if the fellow made any noise he
would be stabbed to death. But the German prisoner
had no intention of risking his life further,
and he nodded vigorously to show that he understood.</p>

<p>With this German thus disposed of, Dave and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
those remaining with him again advanced, this
time with increased caution, for if one German had
found his way into the gully others might do likewise,
and the engineers did not wish to be treated
to a disagreeable surprise.</p>

<p>As they progressed it must not be supposed that
they did not keep their eyes and ears open for what
was going on beyond the gully. Every few feet
they stopped to look up and peer between the rocks
and the stunted undergrowth which overhung the
edges of the depression. Beyond this hollow the
landscape had been torn up and in many places
swept clean by the heavy artillery fire of that day
and of days gone by.</p>

<p>Presently they came to another turn in the gully.
Here there was a deep depression, and they had to
wade through water and mud up to their knees.
They were now getting closer to the German machine-gun
nest, and Dave motioned to his men to
increase their caution and for each of them to hold
a hand-grenade ready for use.</p>

<p>At last they reached a point where it seemed
impossible to go any further. A shell had exploded
in that vicinity and completely blocked the
gully. To advance farther would mean that they
would have to crawl out of the depression and
around a small hill of dirt and sand left by the exploded
shell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>“I don’t know whether we can reach that machine-gun
nest from here or not,” Dave whispered
to the others.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with going over the top
after that nest?” demanded Roger.</p>

<p>“Do you want to do it?” questioned Dave
quickly, turning to all of those under him.</p>

<p>“Sure! Let us go over!” was the whispered
answer. Not an engineer wanted to hold back.</p>

<p>With more caution than ever Dave peeped out
among the rocks and calculated what might be the
chances for success. While he was doing this
he made another discovery, which was to the effect
that while they had been slowly crawling up
the gully another machine-gun of the Germans had
been located almost side by side with the first.
Both guns were popping away constantly, and
evidently doing considerable damage.</p>

<p>“If they should turn their guns this way it
would be all up with us,” said the young sergeant.
“So if we show ourselves we’ll be taking our lives
in our hands.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it? Come on!”</p>

<p>“Don’t let us waste any more time. Those
guns must be doing terrible damage to our fellows.”</p>

<p>“Let us get busy with these hand-grenades
right away.”</p>

<p>They were all enthusiastic, and Dave more so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
than any one else. His eyes lit up with patriotic
fire as he got a hand-grenade ready for use.</p>

<p>“All right, boys! If you say so we’ll go over
the top and at ’em,” he cried. “Get your grenades
ready, but don’t throw until I give the word.
And then be sure to give it to the Heinies just
where it will do the most good.”</p>

<p>There was a brief pause, and then Dave leaped
forth from the gully, followed almost instantly
by all of the others. Away they sped over the
ground in the direction of the machine-gun nests.</p>

<p>They had covered fully fifty feet before the
Germans discovered them. Then a yell went up
and several shots rang out, the bullets whistling
over their heads.</p>

<p>“Now then—all together!” yelled Dave, and
let fly with his hand-grenade. The others hurled
their explosives at the same time.</p>

<p>While two of the hand-grenades went wide of
the mark and one other failed to go off, the others
came down directly in the midst of the two machine-gun
nests. There was a loud explosion, followed
rapidly by a number of others. The machine-guns
were completely wrecked and the bodies
of the gunners were hurled in all directions!</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">A hit</span>! A perfect hit!”</p>

<p>“That’s the time we showed the Huns what we
can do!”</p>

<p>“Say! do you know I believe we killed every
Jerry in the bunch?”</p>

<p>So the cries and comments ran on as the fighting
engineers surveyed the havoc they had wrought.
The hand-grenades had exploded with terrific
force, sending pieces of the machine-guns almost
to where they were standing. All the gun crews
had been either killed or fatally wounded, some of
the bodies being horribly mutilated.</p>

<p>“It certainly makes a fellow sick to look at it,”
murmured Dave to Roger.</p>

<p>“So it does, Dave. But this isn’t child’s play.
It’s stern war.”</p>

<p>The machine-gun nests had been seen from a
distance, but the Yankee soldiers had had no opportunity
to get at them. Now the annihilation
of the nests was viewed with astonishment, which
quickly turned to intense satisfaction. A cheer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
went down the line, and then in a twinkling the
Americans came over at those who had advanced
to lay them low.</p>

<p>The outbreak had been nothing but a skirmish
at the start, but now it was gradually growing into
a genuine battle. Before night the fighting line
extended for over a mile and a half, and the conflict
kept up long after darkness had fallen.</p>

<p>Having accomplished his purpose, Dave ordered
his command to retire. They were just
leaving the end of the gully to get back to the
trench when the young sergeant saw Captain
Obray running toward him.</p>

<p>“What does this mean, Sergeant Porter?
Where have you been?” called out the captain of
the engineers.</p>

<p>“We’ve just blown up two machine-gun nests,
Captain,” answered Dave, with pardonable pride.</p>

<p>“What? Were you responsible for those explosions
we heard in that direction?” and the captain
pointed with his hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Dave; and related some
of the particulars. “I sent Jackson and Meeks
back with a prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw them with the fellow, but just
then I had no time to ask them the particulars,”
answered Captain Obray. “You certainly have
done wonderfully well. Those machine-guns were
doing terrible execution on our boys. With those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
guns going, we could not have advanced at this
point.”</p>

<p>The captain then told Dave that he and the men
under him must retire along with the rest of the
engineering unit.</p>

<p>“Two regiments of the regulars are coming
this way,” he announced, “and they can hold this
ground a great deal better than we can. And
besides that, there will be plenty of work for us
to do just as soon as this battle comes to an end.
Unless I miss my guess, we are going to make
quite an advance on Jerry;” Jerry being the name
by which the Germans were occasionally designated—why,
no one could tell.</p>

<p>The advance and the retirement over the rough
rocks of the gully had been no easy task for the engineers,
and all were glad enough to go back to
the shelter of the unfinished dugout. As they went
down the slope Dave paused just long enough to
see a company of the regulars come into view on
the double-quick.</p>

<p>As said before, the fighting continued far into
the night, and early in the morning it was renewed
and did not come to a stop until about the middle
of the afternoon. By that time the Americans
had made an advance along the line from a half
mile to two miles deep; and once more they began
to dig in with all possible speed.</p>

<p>It was a night not easily forgotten by Dave and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
his chums. They had had no supper, and to cook
under such circumstances was practically out of the
question. They used their emergency rations, and
about two o’clock in the afternoon saw some of the
kitchen details coming forward with hot stew and
coffee. These, along with chunks of bread, were
eagerly devoured by the hungry engineers.</p>

<p>“Well, we sure did make a record for ourselves
in this battle,” remarked Buster, when the fighting
had come to an end. “We ought to get some
credit for smashing up those gun nests.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get it, don’t you worry,” returned
Dave. “You just wait until I make my report.”</p>

<p>The news soon circulated that Dave and his detail
had been instrumental in annihilating the two
German machine-guns with their crews, and the
major of the engineering unit himself came down
to the quarters to praise the young sergeant and
shake hands with every fellow who had been with
him.</p>

<p>“Captain Obray reported this, but I want more
of the particulars,” said the major. “It was
grand! You are certainly helping us keep up the
name of the fighting engineers.”</p>

<p>Partial recognition of what Dave and those under
him had done came very shortly afterwards.
All were cited for bravery, and those who had not
yet received medals did so, much to their satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“I knew you fellows would get medals sooner
or later,” declared Dave to his chums, as he shook
hands with them. “I tell you it takes the Oak
Hall boys to cover themselves with glory.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it was your plan that we followed,
Dave,” said Roger. “I don’t believe anybody
else would have thought of it.”</p>

<p>After that came two weeks of hard work, in the
midst of which another storm descended upon the
engineers, making them miserable for a day or
two.</p>

<p>“But I don’t care,” announced Dave grimly.
“We’re pushing right ahead, and that means a
whole lot. Anything to down the Huns!”</p>

<p>The next morning the skies cleared, and then
the aviators began to get busy. Dave watched
them for a while, for flying always interested him
greatly.</p>

<p>“I think if I wasn’t an engineer I would like to
be an airman,” he told Roger.</p>

<p>“Exactly my idea, Dave. But we are engineers,
and I suppose we’ve got to stick to our jobs
until the war is over.”</p>

<p>“I’m making a bet the war will be over by
Christmas,” broke in Phil.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe the end will come so
quickly as all that!” cried Buster. “I think it
will probably keep on until the middle of next
summer. By that time Germany will have come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
to the end of her resources, and she will have to
sue for peace.”</p>

<p>“I believe the Central Powers are worse off
than we imagine,” said Dave. “They are simply
putting on a bold front, hoping by some manner of
means to bring us to terms.”</p>

<p>“Say, maybe they’ll come to terms like the girl
did when the fellow wanted to marry her!” cried
Shadow. “At first she declared that she wouldn’t
marry him until he earned at least fifty dollars a
week. He was then getting twelve. A few
weeks later he came to her and announced that the
boss had raised his wages to fifteen dollars. ‘All
right, Jack,’ said the girl. ‘Now that you’ve got
your raise I suppose we had better get married.
Fifteen dollars is pretty near to fifty anyhow.’”
And at this there was a general laugh.</p>

<p>Two days later came word to Dave that thrilled
him greatly. He received a commission as a lieutenant
of the engineers, while Roger and Phil became
sergeants and Ben was made a corporal.</p>

<p>“Allow me to congratulate you, Lieutenant
Porter,” said Captain Obray, grasping Dave’s
hand warmly. “I think this gives me almost as
much pleasure as it does you.”</p>

<p>“It certainly makes me feel good, I won’t deny
it,” returned Dave, his eyes gleaming with satisfaction.
“I thought I was going some to become
a sergeant. But to be a lieutenant of the engineers!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
I never dreamed I would get that far
when I joined.”</p>

<p>“I hope to see you get farther yet before this
war is over,” said the captain encouragingly, and
then he went down the line congratulating Roger
and the others on their promotions.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we’ve got to bid you farewell
now, Dave,” said Ben. “As a commissioned officer,
you won’t want to herd with us common
fellows any more.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it for a minute, Ben,” was
Dave’s quick reply. “Of course, when we are on
duty I’ve got to be your lieutenant, but when I’m
not on duty you can take it from me that we are
going to be the old chums we have always been,”
and he caught his first boy friend by both hands
and looked at Ben in a manner that meant a great
deal.</p>

<p>Of course, all of the engineers who had been
promoted had to send the glad tidings to those at
home. Dave wrote a long letter to his father and
another to Jessie, while Roger penned like communications
to his folks in Washington and to
Laura, and Phil did not forget his own people
and Belle Endicott, who was now visiting the
Porters.</p>

<p>But as the sunshine had followed the storm, so
a cloud came two days later to mar our hero’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
happiness. He received a letter from Jessie
which had been over two weeks on the way. In
that the girl mentioned the fact that some folks
in Crumville were treating her rather queerly, and
that one girl in particular, on whom Max Gebauer
had been in the habit of calling, had made a rather
odd remark. The girl’s name was Benson, and
of her Jessie wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I met Mary Benson yesterday in one of the
stores. She spoke about Lieutenant Gebauer and
then suddenly looked at me and shrugged her
shoulders and said: ‘I don’t suppose you hear
from Dave Porter any more. You threw him
aside rather suddenly, didn’t you?’ I demanded
to know what she meant, but she only shrugged
her shoulders and walked off. I felt as if I could
have shaken her good and hard. I never did like
her when we went to school together, and now I
like her less than ever.”</p>
</div>

<p>Then the girl went on to admit that evidently
some folks had got the wrong impression concerning
her and her intimacy with Gebauer. She
added that she and Laura were going to do what
they could to straighten matters out. By reading
between the lines Dave was made well aware of
the fact that the girl he regarded so highly was
having anything but a pleasant time of it because
of what the young jewelry manufacturer from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
Philadelphia had done and said. And it was evident
that Nat Poole had backed up Gebauer as
far as was in his power.</p>

<p>“It’s an outrage! That’s just what it is—an
outrage!” declared Dave, when he talked the matter
over with Roger. “I just wish I could be back
in Crumville for a few days. I’d show those folks
a thing or two.” The idea of having his Jessie
suffer was maddening.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you ought to lay it to the folks
in Crumville,” returned the senator’s son. “I
think you ought to lay it to that Gebauer and Nat.”</p>

<p>Now that Dave had been made a lieutenant of
the engineers he resolved to do everything in his
power to make a creditable showing as a commissioned
officer. He studied his engineering textbooks
and his volumes on French and German at
every opportunity. Nor did he hesitate to go to
Captain Obray and some of the other upper officers
for advice and instruction. This pleased the
older men greatly, and they did all they could to
encourage our hero.</p>

<p>Some days later, when all was quiet in that sector,
Dave obtained permission to go to a French
town about fifteen miles behind the lines. He
wanted to make a few necessary purchases, and as
Roger and Phil also wanted to buy some things
they secured permission to go with him.</p>

<p>The three caught a ride a short part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
distance, and then walked the rest of the way.
They were just on the outskirts of the town when
they saw an American soldier ahead of them with
a small French lad by his side. The French lad,
who was gaunt in appearance, as though half
starved, was lugging a large round bundle
wrapped in old newspapers.</p>

<p>“Please, Monsieur! Please, I cannot carry
the package any farther,” wailed the boy in
French, and he made a move as if to let the package
drop.</p>

<p>“Here, you! None of that!” cried the soldier,
catching the boy by the shoulder. “Go on
with that, or I’ll give you something you won’t
forget very soon!” and he shook his fist in the
French boy’s face and then shoved him along.</p>

<p>“Hello! I wonder what’s the matter with that
brute!” cried Dave, when he saw this action.
“It’s a shame to make a lad like that carry such
a big bundle.”</p>

<p>“And the poor little chap looks half starved,
too,” was Phil’s comment.</p>

<p>“Come on! Let us look into this!” cried
Dave. “No soldier has any right to treat a
French boy like that!” And he strode forward,
never dreaming of the surprise in store for him.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>A PERSONAL AFFAIR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As Dave</span> and his chums strode forward they
saw the soldier ahead of them give the gaunt-looking
French lad another shove. This caused
the poor boy to lose his balance, and over he went
in the roadway, falling on top of the big bundle
he was carrying.</p>

<p>“Hi, you bruiser, stop that!” cried Dave, coming
up behind the soldier and catching him by the
arm. Then, as, rather startled by the interruption,
the fellow whirled around, he added in
amazement: “Nat Poole!”</p>

<p>“See here! what do you mean by grabbing me
by the arm?” demanded the son of the money
lender of Crumville, as soon as he recovered from
his astonishment.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Nat Poole!” exclaimed Roger.</p>

<p>“Who would have thought of meeting him
here?” added Phil.</p>

<p>“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for treating
a poor French boy like this, Nat,” continued
Dave, as he stepped forward and assisted the
fallen boy to his feet. The fellow looked much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
frightened, thus confronted by four soldiers.
Evidently he was afraid he had gotten himself into
serious trouble. He did not understand what was
being said.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ve got a right to hire a boy to carry
a bundle for me,” grumbled Nat.</p>

<p>“Did you hire him?” demanded Dave.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as that’s any of your business,”
was the blustering response.</p>

<p>“Did he hire you to carry the package for
him?” questioned Dave of the boy in the best
French he could command, which, it may be said
here, was far from good.</p>

<p>“That soldier made me carry the bundle. He
makes motions like he would beat me if I did not
do it,” answered the boy, with a shiver.</p>

<p>“He won’t touch you; so don’t be afraid,” said
Dave, and then he looked calmly at Nat.</p>

<p>“See here, Dave Porter! what right have you
to come and butt into my private affairs?”
growled Nat.</p>

<p>“As a commissioned officer of the army I am
bound to see to it that the inhabitants around
here are properly treated,” answered Dave. And
if he said this rather sternly I think he may be
pardoned for so doing.</p>

<p>“A commissioned officer? Humph, you’re
only a sergeant! I don’t see how you got into
that uniform.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“Lieutenant Porter was made a lieutenant some
time ago,” said Phil. “And you had better mind
yourself, Nat, or you’ll get into trouble.”</p>

<p>“So they made you a lieutenant, did they?”
queried Nat; and it was easy to be seen that he
was envious of Dave’s promotion. “Funny the
luck some fellows have!”</p>

<p>While this talk was going on the boy had been
edging farther and farther away from the Americans.
Now he suddenly took to his heels, running
off as if for dear life.</p>

<p>“Now see what you have done!” grumbled
Nat. “I wanted that boy to carry this bundle
into town for me.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with carrying it yourself,
Nat?” suggested Roger. “You are more able
to do it than that poor half-starved kid.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I wasn’t brought up to lug bundles,”
grumbled the money lender’s son.</p>

<p>“Is it your own?” questioned Phil.</p>

<p>“No! It belongs to our captain. He detailed
me to take it into town for him.”</p>

<p>“If he did, he must have done it as a punishment
for you,” returned Dave quickly. He well
knew that privates were often punished by their
superiors for slight infringements of the regulations
by having disagreeable duties assigned to
them. He himself had seen unlucky engineers set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
to work carrying bundles, cleaning up in camp,
and even peeling potatoes and onions for weeks at
a time.</p>

<p>“Never mind why I was carrying the bundle.
I can’t see that it’s any of your business, even if
you are a lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“I won’t argue the point, Nat; but in the future
you take my advice and leave the poor French boys
alone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say! you fellows make me tired,” growled
the money lender’s son. And then, grabbing up
the bundle which still lay in the roadway, he turned
his back on the others and stalked off.</p>

<p>“Say, Dave, I think you ought to report him,”
was Phil’s comment.</p>

<p>“Oh, let it go, Phil,” was the quick reply. “If
I, as a lieutenant, reported Nat, he would claim
that it was nothing but a personal matter between
us. I don’t want to take advantage of my position
when it comes to dealing with somebody I
have known for years. I would rather fight it
out on my own hook, so to speak.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I understand your feelings, Dave—I’d
feel that way myself.”</p>

<p>“If you reported Nat he would make a great
hullabaloo and say you were simply trying to show
your authority,” said Roger. “Just the same, I
am glad we caught him and came to the rescue of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
that boy. We want all of the inhabitants here to
realize that we are their friends and intend to
treat them with perfect fairness.”</p>

<p>The three chums soon reached the town, Nat
Poole having gone in ahead of them. Dave made
his purchases, and Roger and Phil got what they
wanted, and then they walked around to see the
sights. This town had been under bombardment
several times, and while a portion of it was still
in fairly good condition, many of the buildings had
suffered, and at the end of one of the streets the
demolition was complete.</p>

<p>“Just think of having lived here while those
bombardments were going on!” was Dave’s comment,
as they paused in front of one of the buildings,
a rear corner of which was still standing.</p>

<p>“It must make the French people heart-sick to
come back and find their homes nothing but heaps
of rubbish.”</p>

<p>“And to think that the Germans carried off
nearly everything of value,” put in Phil.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Phil, some day we’ll make them
pay the whole bill,” returned Dave. “The only
thing we can’t make good is the loss of life.”</p>

<p>They walked around for over an hour, for this
was the first chance they had had to look over this
particular town. During the winter at the front
they had had an opportunity to go back to two
other ruined places, but at that time the ruins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
had been covered with a thick mantle of snow, so
that they had seen comparatively little.</p>

<p>Walking along one of the streets, which was
still piled high with the debris of the last bombardment,
Dave and his chums had occasion to
walk under what remained of a bridgeway running
from one building across the road to another.</p>

<p>“It’s queer that bridge wasn’t knocked down by
the bombardment,” remarked Roger, as he surveyed
the ruin left on all sides.</p>

<p>“Some of these old stoneworks are remarkably
substantial,” returned Dave. “The engineers of
those days certainly knew their business. Under
ordinary circumstances a bridge like this will last
for thousands of years.”</p>

<p>They came out on the other side of the bridge
and here paused to look around again. Then,
as Dave happened to glance upward, he gave a
sudden cry of alarm:</p>

<p>“Look out there!”</p>

<p>As he spoke there came down on their heads a
perfect shower of dirt, consisting mostly of pulverized
lime and cement. Then, before they
could move, another shower of the same stuff
descended upon them.</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar! do you suppose those buildings
are going to fall?” cried Phil. Some of the dust
had got into his eyes, temporarily blinding him.</p>

<p>“No, nothing is falling,” answered Dave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
quickly. “That stuff came from the top of the
bridgeway and was thrown down on us.”</p>

<p>“Hi there! Stop that!” yelled Roger, and
then repeated his words in French.</p>

<p>“I saw somebody’s arm, and that arm was
dressed in khaki,” said Dave quickly. “I believe
that stuff was thrown down by some of our
soldiers. I am going up there to investigate.
Come along.”</p>

<p>To get up on the bridgeway was not difficult.
They had to pass into what was left of one of the
houses and then make their way up a rather rickety
pair of stairs. Then they passed over a shaky
floor and through a doorway leading to the bridge.</p>

<p>As they did this, Dave, who was well in advance,
caught sight of two figures in khaki—those
of a private and an officer. The two had
been laughing boisterously, but now, as Dave and
his chums came up on the bridge the others started
away from them. But the far end of the bridge
was blocked by the ruins of the building beyond,
and the fleeing ones had to come to a halt.</p>

<p>“It’s Nat Poole, just as I thought,” said Dave
to his chums.</p>

<p>“Who is that fellow with him?” questioned
Roger.</p>

<p>“I’m not quite sure, Roger, but he looks like
Gebauer.”</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“So it is! I recognize him now. Well, what
do you know about this!”</p>

<p>In another moment the two parties were confronting
each other. Nat looked rather sullen,
while Lieutenant Gebauer put on a front as if the
affair did not concern him in the least. Of course
the engineers saluted, and Gebauer did likewise.</p>

<p>“Nat, did you throw that stuff down on top of
us?” demanded Dave.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you are talking about,”
was the low reply.</p>

<p>“Yes, you do,” put in Roger quickly, and going
forward he grabbed Nat by the arm.</p>

<p>“Roger Morr, you let me alone!” howled the
money lender’s son, a trifle frightened.</p>

<p>“This is Lieutenant Gebauer, I believe?” remarked
Dave, a bit stiffly.</p>

<p>“You are right. And you are—?” and here
the lieutenant paused.</p>

<p>“I am Lieutenant Porter. I think you ought
to remember me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I remember you now. You come
from the same town that Poole does,” said Gebauer
slowly.</p>

<p>“I suppose both of you thought it was a good
joke to throw that dirt down on us?” continued
Dave, eying the other lieutenant squarely.</p>

<p>“Oh, soldiers have got to have a little fun, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
know,” said Gebauer coolly, and, taking a cigarette
from a case, he started to light it.</p>

<p>“It’s no fun to throw lime dust around,”
growled Phil, who was still rubbing his eyes.
“For two pins, Nat Poole, I’d give you the
thrashing of your life.”</p>

<p>“There will be no fighting done here!” cried
Lieutenant Gebauer sternly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had a hand in this, Lieutenant?”
said Dave quickly.</p>

<p>“Ha! do you accuse me, Porter?” and the
other officer drew himself up proudly.</p>

<p>“I know there were two lots of that stuff came
down on our heads. Did Poole throw both of
them?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t!” was the quick reply. “I—I—”
and then Nat stopped.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you should make such a row
over a little fun,” remarked Gebauer, puffing away
at his cigarette. “It’s dull enough around here.
We’ve got to stir things up a little.”</p>

<p>“Well, after this when you stir things up, you
keep away from me,” said Dave coldly.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that as a threat, Porter?”</p>

<p>“I mean that as a warning.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause, and twice Lieutenant
Gebauer made a move as if to speak. But
then he merely shrugged his shoulders and flipped
the ashes from his cigarette.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“Life is too short to quarrel, Porter,” he remarked
finally. “Have it your own way.”</p>

<p>“I intend to have it my own way.” Dave
stepped a bit closer. “I believe you know well
enough, Lieutenant Gebauer, that I have a little
personal account to settle with you. But that can
wait. Just the same, I want you and this cowardly
young fellow here to understand that you have got
to keep your distance. Otherwise there is going
to be real trouble for both of you.”</p>

<p>“See here! You—you—can’t—er—threaten
me like this!” stammered Gebauer, not
knowing how to proceed.</p>

<p>“Come on, boys; I’ve had my say,” said Dave
to his chums, utterly ignoring the splutterings of
Gebauer. Nat was mumbling something under
his breath, but what it was, nobody understood.</p>

<p>Then Dave and his friends left the bridge and

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>AT THE TRENCHES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following week was such a busy one for
Dave that Lieutenant Gebauer and Nat Poole
were practically forgotten. The engineers were
moved somewhat to the north of the position they
had occupied, and were there set to work at their
usual task of building roads and bridges.</p>

<p>“One thing is certain,” said Dave, one day
when he and the others had knocked off for dinner.
“Whatever ground our soldiers have taken they
have managed to keep.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we don’t know how to retreat,” returned
Phil, with a grin.</p>

<p>“I understand some new troops are coming to
the front here,” said Roger, who had just returned
from the other end of the roadway they were constructing.
“I met a corporal I know slightly, and
he was telling me about them.” And he mentioned
the number of the regiment.</p>

<p>“Why, Roger, that’s the command to which
Nat Poole belongs!” cried Dave.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I took particular notice. And Gebauer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
belongs, too. In fact, he is a lieutenant of Nat’s
company.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m mighty sorry to hear that they are
coming anywhere near us,” was Phil’s comment,
and he looked thoughtfully at our hero as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, too, in one way,” answered Dave
promptly. “As soon as Nat Poole shows himself
there is bound to be some sort of trouble.”</p>

<p>“And what about that Lieutenant Gebauer?”
questioned Roger. “I know well enough you’ve
got it in for him, Dave.”</p>

<p>“If Dave has, it’s because Gebauer deserves
it,” remarked Phil.</p>

<p>“Oh, if he doesn’t bother me I won’t bother
him,” answered our hero. “Just the same, if I
get a chance I’m going to let him know I am aware
of how he acted in Crumville, and that I don’t give
him any credit for causing Jessie trouble.”</p>

<p>The weather now was all that could be desired,
and the work of building roads and bridges
progressed rapidly. On some of the bridge work
there was considerable planning to be done, and
Dave had to spend a good many hours over some
blueprints. But he had the satisfaction of accomplishing
what he had set out to do, and received
some warm praise from Captain Obray.</p>

<p>“I knew it was in you, Porter,” said the captain
heartily. “You are certainly a natural-born civil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
engineer. I predict after this war is over that
you’ll make quite a hit with the Mentor Construction
Company or some other big concern.”</p>

<p>During those days Dave sent several letters
home and received one communication, this time
from Caspar Potts. The old professor wrote in
a very trembling hand, and the communication
consisted of less than a dozen lines. But brief as
it was, it went straight to our hero’s heart.</p>

<p>“Dear old man!” he murmured, after he had
read the letter several times. “If ever there was
a good old soul in this world, that soul is Caspar
Potts.” And he closed his eyes for a moment as
a vision passed through his mind of the white-haired
and trembling professor sitting in the
Wadsworth library, adjusting his gold-rimmed
spectacles to pore over one of his precious volumes.</p>

<p>The new troops to come to that vicinity arrived
three days later while the engineers were hard at
work. The company to which Nat Poole and
Lieutenant Gebauer belonged were located in one
of the second-line trenches, and immediately proceeded
to make themselves as much at home as
possible. Most of the soldiers took all the inconveniences
good-naturedly, but the son of the
money lender of Crumville did his usual share of
grumbling.</p>

<p>“It’s a rotten place to stay in,” was Nat’s comment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
“I don’t see why they can’t have the engineers
fix up some really good quarters for us fellows.”</p>

<p>He was speaking to Gebauer at the time. Although
Gebauer was a commissioned officer and
Nat was only a private, the two, for some unknown
reason, were very friendly. They had
many tastes in common, and always acted chummy
when no one else was present.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t blame me, Nat,” replied the lieutenant,
bringing out his cigarette-case and supplying
himself. “Have a cigarette. Maybe that
will help you forget your troubles,” and he gave
a sickly grin.</p>

<p>“I wonder how much longer this war is going
to last.”</p>

<p>“That remains to be found out. Personally,
I think the Germans are going to give us the fight
of our lives,” continued Gebauer, in a somewhat
lower voice.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we can lick ’em?” demanded
Nat.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Gebauer shrugged his shoulders.
“I’m not doing any thinking along those lines.
I’m simply obeying orders. I guess we both know
what we think of this war, anyhow,” and closing
one eye he looked at Nat suggestively.</p>

<p>“We sure do! It was a howling shame to
drag us over here, three thousand miles from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
home, to fight,” grumbled the money lender’s son.</p>

<p>“Sh-sh! Don’t talk so loud, Nat,” murmured
the lieutenant warningly. “If anybody heard
you, you’d get into hot water.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care! It’s true, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Every word. I’d rather be back home right
now than here. I think I could make a barrel of
money out of our business in spite of the war.
And what am I getting out of this? A measly
lieutenant’s pay!”</p>

<p>“Humph! you get a pile more than I do as a
common soldier.” Nat looked at his companion
slyly. “I guess you’d like it first rate to be back
in Crumville again with Jessie Wadsworth,
wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. That would depend on
how she treated me.”</p>

<p>“You two didn’t get along very well during the
last few days of your stay, did you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we got along well enough. But I’ve got
to be going now. There is a whole lot I’ve got
to do,” continued the lieutenant hastily, and then
walked away.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you got the cold shoulder somehow,”
murmured Nat, gazing after the retreating officer.
“Just the same, I’m sorry you didn’t get in with
Jessie, and put a spoke in Dave Porter’s wheel.”</p>

<p>Two days later one of the working units of the
fighting engineers was sent back to do some work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
on one of the trenches, part of which had caved in,
blocking up the entrance to a dugout. Dave was in
command of the men, and, as it happened, the
dugout which had suffered was the one in which
Gebauer and a number of other officers were
quartered. Gebauer was in very ill humor, for
his cot and some of his extra clothing had been
covered with a shower of dirt and stones.</p>

<p>“That was a fine way to build a dugout,” he
grumbled in Dave’s hearing. “If I couldn’t do
better than that as an engineer, I’d resign,” and
he looked directly at our hero.</p>

<p>“These trenches and dugouts were not made
by our unit,” returned Dave. “Just the same, I
consider they were built as well as circumstances
permitted. These are only temporary quarters,
as you know. And such an accident as this is
liable to happen any time. We’ll cut down some
saplings and limbs and shore this up, and fix some
of the stonework, and then it will be as good as
ever, or better.”</p>

<p>“Humph! maybe it will be,” grumbled Gebauer,
and turned his back on the engineers.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of new trouble with
not only Gebauer, but Nat Poole also. Both of
these unworthies showed plainly that they did not
like Dave or his chums at all, and they did everything
they possibly could to annoy our hero. Of
course, as a private, Nat was somewhat at a disadvantage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
but Gebauer invariably tried to show
his authority, especially when the higher officers
were absent. He attempted to dictate to Dave,
and this brought on a very animated discussion.</p>

<p>“See here, Lieutenant Gebauer,” said the young
engineer finally, “you tend to your business and
I’ll tend to mine. I know what my duty here is,
and you have no authority to interfere with it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t have to ride a high horse,
Porter,” growled Gebauer.</p>

<p>“I am not riding a high horse. If I were doing
that, I would probably tell you a few things
that you would hate to hear.”</p>

<p>“What about?” demanded the other hotly.
They had walked down one of the trenches and
were out of hearing of the others.</p>

<p>“Well, if you must know, about the way you
made a fool of yourself in Crumville. I have had
the particulars of how you acted, and I must
say you played the part of anything but a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to insult me?”</p>

<p>“I am not going to try to do that, Gebauer.
It would probably be too much of a job.”</p>

<p>“Say, I guess you don’t know who you are talking
to!”</p>

<p>“I do know. And if you think you can intimidate
me, you are mistaken.”</p>

<p>“My, but you are getting on your high horse!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
sneered Gebauer. “I must say you are showing
your poorhouse training.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” and now a sudden flash of fire
came into Dave’s eyes and he caught the other
lieutenant by the arm.</p>

<p>“You let go of me, Porter!” and Gebauer
shrank back in sudden alarm.</p>

<p>“I won’t let any one talk to me like that,” said
Dave, firmly.</p>

<p>At that moment came an unexpected interruption.
There was a call from above the trench,
and several officers appeared, including the major
of the command to which Gebauer belonged.
Those below at once saluted, and there the sudden
quarrel came to just as rapid a termination. But
Gebauer glared bitterly at our hero as the latter
took his departure.</p>

<p>This meeting upset Dave for the rest of the
day—so much so that he could hardly attend to
his duties. Phil and Roger, as well as Ben, noticed
this, and during their time off in the evening
he told his chums of what had occurred.</p>

<p>“Gee, Dave, it’s a wonder you didn’t smash
him in the face when he talked to you like that!”
cried Ben.</p>

<p>“I felt like doing it, Ben; and it was all I could
do to control myself,” returned our hero. “But
you know what the regulations are about fighting,
especially here at the front.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“Just the same, this Gebauer ought to be
taught a lesson,” was Phil’s comment.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why they made such a fellow as
that a lieutenant,” came from Roger. “It’s a
shame, with so many good men around!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think Gebauer will get much higher in
the army,” said Dave. “If he treats the men
under him as he has treated us, sooner or later
they will all hate him.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, he looks to me as if he might be
sort of pro-German,” remarked Ben thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, one thing is sure—” began Dave, when
a sudden alarm broke out which ended the talk
right then and there.</p>

<p>The alarm was followed by a sudden burst of
artillery, which soon increased in intensity, while
the night was lit up by the flare of rockets and
“flaming onions,” as they were called.</p>

<p>“I wonder what that means!” cried Shadow,
as he came running up to the others.</p>

<p>“I think it means some sort of a fight,” answered
Dave. “But whether we are going to
attack or the Germans, remains to be seen.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>THE GERMAN PRISONER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was fighting that night all along the
line, but nothing in the way of a battle developed
and the engineers did not participate in the contest
any further than that they were called on to
repair some bridges along the roadway where the
shell-fire of the enemy made several telling hits.</p>

<p>“The Huns are certainly showing some strong
resistance to our advance,” remarked Roger,
while the bombardment was going on.</p>

<p>“Oh, I shouldn’t be surprised if they contested
every foot of the ground,” returned Dave.
“They thought they were going to walk right into
Paris, and it makes them more than mad to be
driven back this way.”</p>

<p>“One thing is certain,” said Phil. “These old
Hindenburg trenches are marvels of completeness.”</p>

<p>“I heard of one German dugout that was fitted,
out like a first-class hotel, with a bath and even a
billiard-table! Those high muck-a-mucks certainly
take care of themselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“Yes, and they take mighty good care that
they are not hit, too!” added Ben. “They let
their common soldiers take all the hard knocks.
You very seldom hear of anybody connected with
the royal families getting even a scratch.”</p>

<p>Early in the morning there was a sortie on the
part of one of the American battalions. They
had located some Germans hidden in a patch of
wood, and after some fierce fighting succeeded in
surrounding a part of the enemy and making them
prisoners. A little later these fellows, to the number
of thirty, with a lieutenant and a sergeant,
were marched to the American rear.</p>

<p>At the time the prisoners were brought in, Dave
and his detail were at work on the roadway which
the prisoners and those in charge of them used.
Along this roadway was also stationed the company
of soldiers to which Lieutenant Gebauer and
Nat Poole belonged.</p>

<p>As Dave went about his duties he passed Gebauer
and Nat several times. Both of them glared
at him, but no words passed. However, five minutes
later Dave saw Nat approach the lieutenant,
and an earnest conversation followed. Both
looked several times toward our hero, and Dave
felt certain that the pair were talking about him.</p>

<p>“And it’s dollars to doughnuts they are not saying
anything very nice,” mused our hero. “Probably
they are plotting as to what they can do to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
the better of me. I suppose I had better keep my
eyes open as long as they are around.”</p>

<p>A little later he had occasion to give Phil and
Ben some directions, and the latter called Dave to
one side.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ve noticed that Nat Poole and
Lieutenant Gebauer are around?”</p>

<p>“Yes indeed! I have passed them several
times, Ben.”</p>

<p>“I went by them, too, and I heard your name
mentioned. I believe they are hatching up something.”</p>

<p>“If I were you I wouldn’t stand any nonsense
from either of them,” put in Phil.</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you had better report them?”</p>

<p>“No; I intend to fight this out alone. Of
course, if they do anything that is too outrageous,
I’ll have to mention it to those higher up.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later it was announced that the
German prisoners were coming, and, as was customary,
all the Americans in that vicinity lined the
roadway to get a look at those who had been captured.</p>

<p>For the most part the prisoners appeared a
silent and thoughtful crowd. A few of them were
decidedly sullen, as if ready to break out at any
moment, and these the guards watched closely, for
it was remembered that on one occasion a prisoner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
had suddenly gone violently insane, killing one of
his captors and then inflicting injury on himself
from which he had later died. On another occasion
several prisoners had made a wild dash for
liberty but had been shot down before they could
get any great distance.</p>

<p>When the prisoners came up close to where
Dave and his chums were standing, the officer in
charge for some reason or other called a temporary
halt. Then began a good-natured gibing
between the soldiers on both sides, a few of the
Americans being able to talk German and one or
two of the prisoners answering in broken English.</p>

<p>Dave was looking over the brought-in men and
noting how starved and ill-clad they were when
he became interested in one man who was gazing
with wide-open eyes at the Americans. Following
this man’s gaze, Dave saw that the prisoner
was looking intently at Lieutenant Gebauer.</p>

<p>“Gebauer! Max Gebauer! What are you
doing here?” called out the German in his guttural
language.</p>

<p>At the mention of his name Lieutenant Gebauer
gazed at the prisoner, and Dave felt certain that
he started as he did so. Then, with swift steps,
Gebauer came to the prisoner’s side. There was
a low exchange of words which Dave could not
catch, even had he known the German language
better than was the case. Gebauer looked much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
annoyed, while the prisoner’s features betrayed
great astonishment.</p>

<p>A short argument ensued, but in the midst of
this the American lieutenant suddenly put up his
hand and motioned for the prisoner to keep quiet.
Then, as he stepped back, he made other motions
as if to draw a wallet from his pocket and count
out imaginary bank-notes. Then he placed a finger
across his lips, turned and walked away.</p>

<p>Roger, Phil, and Ben, as well as Dave, saw all
of these actions, and were of course tremendously
interested. They realized at once that Gebauer
and the German prisoner were well acquainted.</p>

<p>“It’s as plain as day that Gebauer wants that
fellow to keep his mouth shut about something,”
remarked Phil, when the prisoners had resumed
their march to the rear.</p>

<p>“Yes. And it’s equally plain that he proposes
to pay the fellow for doing it,” returned Dave.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose it is all about?” came,
with a puzzled look, from Ben.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” answered the young
lieutenant.</p>

<p>“I wonder if it’s possible that Gebauer is some
sort of a spy and that soldier knows it,” mused
Roger.</p>

<p>“Anything is possible, Roger. But that fellow
may be nothing more than some business acquaintance.
More than likely the Gebauer Jewelry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
Company had a connection in Germany previous
to the war—a great many of those German-American
firms had. That fellow may be nothing
but a business friend.”</p>

<p>“But why would he make a motion as if to pay
him money and motion to him to keep his mouth
shut?” questioned Phil.</p>

<p>“Maybe Gebauer doesn’t want folks generally
to know he had a German connection,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think this ought to be reported?”
questioned Roger.</p>

<p>“I’ll speak to Captain Obray about it,” answered
Dave. “And then I am going to see if I
can’t get a chance to talk to that German prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Can you talk enough German to do it,
Dave?”</p>

<p>“I can get an interpreter.”</p>

<p>Our hero lost no time in mentioning what he
had seen to Captain Obray, and that afternoon
obtained permission to visit the place where the
German prisoners were being kept that night.
This was in a barbed-wire compound hastily laid
out for that purpose by some of the engineers.</p>

<p>Dave had taken a good look at the German
who had spoken to Max Gebauer, and he had
little trouble in picking the fellow out from the
one hundred and twenty men who filled the wire
enclosure. He took Roger with him, and also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
one of the engineers who could speak fairly good
German.</p>

<p>He found the prisoner to be a man of about
forty, tall and thin, with light hair and watery
blue eyes. When questioned he gave his name as
August Besswig, and said that he had been a bookkeeper
for a large manufacturing firm in Frankfort.</p>

<p>“Ask him how it is that he happens to know a
man by the name of Max Gebauer,” said Dave to
the interpreter.</p>

<p>When this question was put to the prisoner he
looked rather disturbed and then shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“Max Gebauer? Who is he?” he returned
after a pause.</p>

<p>“He is the man you were speaking to on your
way to this camp,” said the interpreter, after some
words with Dave.</p>

<p>“Oh, that man! I don’t know him very well.”</p>

<p>“How do you happen to know him at all?”
was the next question put.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s this way, if you must know. Some
years ago I worked for a large jewelry firm in
Germany. We did business with the Gebauer firm
in America. That is how I got to know Mr.
Max Gebauer. He used to come to our place
once a year or so on business.”</p>

<p>“Did he come after the war broke out?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“He was there when that happened, but he
got out very quickly,” answered August Besswig.</p>

<p>After that he was questioned at some length
regarding Gebauer, but made evasive answers.
It was evident that he knew something about
Gebauer which he did not wish to mention, but
what it was there was no telling. At last Dave
had the interpreter bring the interview to an end.</p>

<p>“That German prisoner is a foxy one,” was
Roger’s comment. “I believe he could tell a
great deal if he wanted to.”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly my idea, too,” answered Dave.
“One thing is certain, he and Gebauer have something
in common.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, Dave. And the next question is—has
that to do with the present or the past?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m inclined to think it has something
to do with the past,” replied Dave. “From
what I can find out, this Besswig is nothing but
a private soldier who was forced into the army.
That being so, it is not likely that he would have
anything to do with Gebauer if the latter were
up to some shady work for the Government. I
think it concerns something that took place in the
past, and it looks to me as if it was something which
Gebauer wants this Besswig to keep quiet about.”</p>

<p>Dave thought he might have another interview
with the prisoner later; but on the following day
August Besswig was marched off to a camp twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
miles distant and he had no opportunity for further
talk with the fellow. He tried to keep an
eye on Gebauer, but his duties as an engineer
prevented this, and consequently he did not know
an important fact, which was that two days later
Gebauer got a twenty-four-hours leave of absence
and hurried off to find out what had become of
August Besswig and to go to see the prisoner.</p>

<p>When Gebauer came back to camp he was in
both a thoughtful and an ugly mood. He smoked
one cigarette after another in a nervous manner,
and then interviewed Nat Poole.</p>

<p>“Your friend Porter seems to be a pretty fresh
sort of individual,” grumbled the lieutenant, as
he paced up and down in front of Nat.</p>

<p>“Don’t call him a friend of mine, Max,” was
the quick reply of the money lender’s son. “I
like him about as much as I like a hop-toad.”</p>

<p>“He’s doing his best to get me into trouble,”
continued Gebauer.</p>

<p>“Why, what has he done now?” questioned
Nat, with sudden interest.</p>

<p>“Oh, a whole lot of things. Do you remember
those prisoners that came in a few days ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I happen to know one of those fellows
very slightly—a fellow who was connected with
a jewelry concern in Germany with which our
concern in Philadelphia used to do a little business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“Well, Porter saw me say a few words in a
friendly way to that fellow, and he at once had
the prisoner interviewed and did his best to make
out that I had some sort of a German connection.
Of course, he’s doing his best to get me in Dutch
with the military authorities!” stormed the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t find out anything to your disadvantage,
did he?” questioned Nat.</p>

<p>“Of course not! How could he? I haven’t
done anything wrong!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, what are you afraid of?”</p>

<p>“What am I afraid of? Don’t I know the
kind of fellow Dave Porter is? He wouldn’t
like anything better than to cook something up
with that prisoner so as to get me in bad. I know
him! I’ve a good mind to fix him!”</p>

<p>“Let’s do it!” Nat’s eyes began to shine with
expectancy. “I’d like nothing better than to put
one over on him. He’s getting altogether too
big for his boots. Now that he is a lieutenant,
he thinks he can lord it over everybody. I
suppose when he gets back to Crumville he’ll put
on airs something fierce. According to the stories
he’ll tell, he’ll have been the one to win the whole
war.”</p>

<p>After this the two continued their conversation
for the best part of an hour. Both were exceedingly
bitter against Dave, Nat on account of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
many things which had happened ever since he had
gone to Oak Hall, and Gebauer because of the
way he had been given the cold shoulder by Jessie
Wadsworth.</p>

<p>“If you are game to do it, Nat, I think we can
put a good big one over on Porter,” said Gebauer
at last. “Of course, it will require a little nerve
to do it.”</p>

<p>“What do you propose to do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that isn’t exactly clear in my mind yet.
But I’ll hatch out something before long. But
how about you? Are you willing to stand by
me?”</p>

<p>“Sure I am! Unless, of course, you should
want to go too far,” answered Nat Poole, his
natural cowardice suddenly asserting itself.</p>

<p>“Oh, we won’t go too far. We’ll only do
something that will get him in bad with those
higher up. Then maybe he’ll be placed in disgrace,
and possibly reduced to the ranks.”</p>

<p>“Gee, that sounds good to me!” cried Nat.
“Let’s go and do it!”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll work with me?”</p>

<p>“I sure will! And the sooner you get at it,
the better.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>AT THE BROOK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great World War which had now raged
so furiously for four years was rapidly approaching
its climax. The Germans had been driven
from the vicinity of Paris, they had suffered their
great defeats on the Marne and at Verdun at
the hands of the entente Allies, and now the
American troops had beaten them back at Château
Thierry and other points, while the Italians were
hammering the Austrians mercilessly in the mountains
of upper Italy.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile there had been naval battles
in the North Sea and the Mediterranean, and
the extraordinary submarine campaign of the Germans
had proved to be more or less a failure.</p>

<p>Our soldiers were coming over the Atlantic as
fast as our transports could carry them, and what
was equally important, we were sending immense
quantities of food, ammunition and other supplies
to those who were fighting this tremendous war
with us.</p>

<p>With the Americans and their Allies thus pushing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
the Germans back at every available opportunity,
there was plenty of work for the engineers.
More than once Dave and those under him found
themselves working ten and twelve and even fourteen
hours on a stretch, and doing this in places
which were as dangerous as they were uncomfortable.
More than once they were out when it was
raining furiously, and on two occasions after an
early breakfast they got nothing more to eat until
nightfall.</p>

<p>“If anybody thinks being an army engineer is
a cinch, he’s got another guess coming to him,”
remarked Ben one evening, after an extra hard
day’s labor.</p>

<p>“You never said a truer thing than that, Ben,”
returned Phil. “Gosh! how my back does
ache!”</p>

<p>“I know what I’m going to do,” put in Roger.
“I’m going bathing. There is nothing that refreshes
me half so much as a bath after a hard
day’s work.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go with you,” said Dave. “I
saw a dandy spot to-day, while we were fixing that
bridge.”</p>

<p>“And that’s just the place I had in mind,” said
the senator’s son.</p>

<p>When there was a favorable opportunity the
engineers often took a little time off to go bathing
in one of the rivers or brooks that was handy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
taking care, of course, to select only a place where
the water was clean and pure—not an easy thing
to do in a locality where so many dead bodies
of soldiers were to be found.</p>

<p>Dave and all of his chums from Oak Hall
formed the party which went bathing. They had
found a tributary to one of the larger streams,
and this was fed mostly by springs. The water
was consequently quite cold, but was absolutely
pure, and for this they were thankful. They lost
no time in disrobing, and then one after another
plunged in.</p>

<p>“I’m going up the stream a way and do a bit
of exploring,” said Ben presently, and sloshed
along through the water and over the rocks.
And presently one after another followed until
only Dave was left behind. He was more interested
in getting a good bath than in doing any
exploring, and, sitting down on a rock in the water,
he proceeded to make himself just as much at
home as though he was in one of the bathtubs at
the Wadsworth mansion.</p>

<p>Although Dave did not know it, the departure
of the Oak Hall chums for the bathing-place had
been noticed by Nat Poole, who chanced along
at that particular time. Walking through the
brushwood, Nat presently approached the place
where the young engineers had gone in bathing.</p>

<p>“Gee, I guess here is a chance to play a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
trick on those fellows,” observed the money
lender’s son, with a sickly grin.</p>

<p>Not far from where Nat was standing rested
Dave’s uniform and his other garments. Watching
his opportunity, when Dave was not looking
in that direction, Nat leaped forth from behind
the bushes and gathered up the things in his arms.</p>

<p>The rascal might have escaped undetected had
it not been for a mishap which overtook him when
he least expected it. With the uniform and other
things piled high in his arms he could not see
where he was stepping, and suddenly one foot
went down in a crevice between the rocks, and he
pitched headlong.</p>

<p>The noise Nat made was not great, but it was
sufficient to attract Dave’s attention, and looking
in that direction he saw in an instant what was
occurring.</p>

<p>“Hi, you! Drop those things!” he cried, and
then, leaping up, he made a dash for the bank of
the stream.</p>

<p>Much startled, Nat Poole arose to his feet.
He had now no longer any desire to take the
garments, his one thought being to get away without
being recognized. So far Dave had not seen
his face and now he did what he could to hide
his features.</p>

<p>But the young lieutenant did not intend to allow
the would-be joker to escape thus easily.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
Thinking it might be somebody from his own
command, he leaped quickly over the rocks and
caught Nat by the arm just as the latter was trying
to worm his way into the bushes.</p>

<p>“Nat Poole!” he ejaculated, as he brought
the soldier around with a twist of the arm. “So
this is what you are up to, eh?”</p>

<p>“Aw! it was only a joke,” pleaded the money
lender’s son.</p>

<p>“You were going to run away with my uniform
and all the rest of my things!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I say it was only a joke? Can’t you
take a little fun, Dave Porter?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like that kind of fun, Nat Poole! I
would have cut a fine spectacle if you had gotten
away with my clothing. You just come along
and explain yourself;” and thus speaking, Dave
dragged the unwilling soldier out from the bushes
and down to the side of the stream. Then he
let out a low but well-known whistle, to which
his chums immediately responded, that having
been the “get-together” call at Oak Hall.</p>

<p>“Hello, it’s Nat Poole!” cried Phil.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here, Nat?” questioned
Roger.</p>

<p>“I just caught him trying to steal my things,”
explained Dave.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t going to steal ’em!” stormed Nat.
“I was just going to hide ’em behind the bushes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“He’d have gotten away with them if he hadn’t
stumbled,” continued our hero. “I heard the
noise, and I was just in time to grab him.”</p>

<p>“He ought to be reported for that,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“Humph! that’s just like you fellows—report
a fellow just for having a bit of fun.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’ll take the trouble to report
you, Nat,” answered Dave coolly. “It isn’t
worth it. But after this, I want you to keep your
distance. If you don’t, you’ll get something that
you won’t like.” And having thus delivered himself,
Dave gave Nat Poole a vigorous shake and
then gave him such a shove that he stumbled backward
several steps and then went flat on his back
in some low brushwood.</p>

<p>Such vigorous treatment aroused all of Nat
Poole’s ire, and scrambling to his feet he rushed
toward Dave.</p>

<p>“You’re not going to treat me that way!” he
bawled. “I won’t stand it!” And then he
shoved his fist under our hero’s nose.</p>

<p>This was too much for Dave to stand, and disrobed
as he was, he leaped at the money lender’s
son, knocking the fist to one side and then delivering
a stinging blow which took Nat squarely in
the chin, causing him to stagger back several paces.</p>

<p>“Now you go on about your business, Nat
Poole!” he said sternly. “And you remember
what I told you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“You just wait, Dave Porter! I’ll fix you
yet!”</p>

<p>“Nat, shut up and do what Dave told you,”
put in Roger. “You are the meanest pill that
ever came out of a box. Go on!” and he waved
his hand threateningly.</p>

<p>“You are a disgrace to the uniform you are
wearing,” added Phil.</p>

<p>“Oh, sure! There is no use of my talking,
with all of you against me!” grumbled Nat.
“Just the same, I’ll get square some day, you
mark my words!” And having thus delivered
himself, Nat Poole slunk away and was soon lost
to sight in the brushwood.</p>

<p>“How I would like to have a fellow like that
for a brother,” remarked Shadow sarcastically.</p>

<p>“His father must be proud of him,” was Buster’s
comment.</p>

<p>“He and his father are two of a kind,” explained
Ben. “At the start of the war they were
both slackers. The only member of the family
that is worth while is Mrs. Poole. She has done
a lot for the Red Cross and other war organizations,
and I am mighty sorry that she has to put
up with such folks as Nat and Mr. Poole.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to keep your eyes open, Dave,”
observed Phil. “Nat will do his best to square
accounts, and he’ll probably get Gebauer to aid
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“It’s a pity Nat doesn’t try to make something
of himself while he is in the army,” observed
Dave. “He has just as good a chance as any of
us.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t in him,” said Buster. “You can’t
build a marble palace out of mud.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say! Speaking of mud, puts me in mind
of a story I heard yesterday,” cried Shadow.
“Three Americans were in the end of a trench,
and they were completely surrounded by Germans.
They were out of ammunition and didn’t know
what to do. The trench was full of mud and
water, and as the Germans came down to make
them prisoners the three Americans grabbed up
some buckets which were handy, filled them with
mud and water, and let the Germans have the
dose full in the face. Then they leaped out and
ran for their lives. One of them was killed, but
the other two got away.”</p>

<p>“They certainly took chances,” answered
Dave; “but that’s the American style.”</p>

<p>Making his way through the brushwood, Nat
Poole presently came out on the forest road, and
then lost no time in hurrying back to camp. He
was in anything but a good humor, and his face
showed it.</p>

<p>“Well, Nat, why the thunder-cloud look?”
queried Lieutenant Gebauer, when he saw his
crony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>“Oh, I had another run-in with that Dave
Porter,” growled the money lender’s son. “Say,
that fellow makes me tired all over!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he makes you any more tired
than he does me,” said the lieutenant, bringing
out his ever-present cigarette-case and lighting up.</p>

<p>“I thought you were going to think out something
by which we could get square with him?”
continued Nat. “I know what I’d like to do!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to disgrace him! And say, Max, if
we could get him disgraced maybe Jessie Wadsworth
wouldn’t have anything more to do with
him, and that would give you a chance.”</p>

<p>To this the lieutenant did not reply at once.
He blew a ring of smoke into the air, took another
puff, and threw the cigarette on the ground.</p>

<p>“I might as well tell you,” he said finally.
“I’ve been watching Porter every opportunity I
get. Sooner or later our chance will come.
When it does, I want you to be ready to act with
me.”</p>

<p>“I told you before that I would do that.”</p>

<p>“I happened to hear some conversation yesterday
that put me to thinking,” pursued Lieutenant
Gebauer. “The engineers are going to move in
a day or two. They are going to lay out a road
in the vicinity of some abandoned coal or iron
mines. I rather think they’ll have their headquarters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
in the mines, just as the Germans were
quartered there when they were in that vicinity.”</p>

<p>“Well, what if they do go to those mines?”
questioned Nat.</p>

<p>“I think it’s a pretty lonely sort of region around
those mines,” returned Gebauer. “And that being
so, we may have more of a chance to get at
Porter. If he went off to explore any of the
mines—or anything like that—we might get a
chance to follow him. Anyway, I am going to
keep my eyes wide open at every opportunity.
And I want you to do the same. We’ll never
catch him unless we watch him like a cat watches
a mouse.”</p>

<p>“Gee, if only we could get the best of him!”
sighed Nat. “I’ve wanted to do it ever since we
went to boarding-school together.”</p>

<p>“The time will come, don’t worry. Sooner or
later, Nat, we’ll get Dave Porter just where we
want him. And when that time comes—well,
he had better look out for himself, that’s all!”
concluded Lieutenant Gebauer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>ATTACKED IN THE DARK</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">These</span> old mines must have been worked for
all they were worth.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way it looks to me, Roger. And
yet I’ve no doubt that with up-to-date mining
methods they might get a good deal more out of
these places.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know that, Dave. Modern mining
machinery has accomplished wonders for the
mines in the United States.”</p>

<p>About a week had passed since Dave had had
the quarrel with Nat Poole at the brook, and
during that time the engineers had been moved
forward to the vicinity of the abandoned mines
mentioned by Lieutenant Gebauer. Here they
were busy repairing the roads which had once
been used by the Germans and left by them in a
most deplorable condition. Trees and huge
masses of rocks blocked the way and great
masses of abandoned wire entanglements had been
strung around wherever it was thought they would
impede the progress of the Americans.</p>

<p>It was bad enough to get rid of the rocks and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
the trees, but it was even worse to dispose of the
wire. Much of this was rusty, and they had to be
very careful how they handled the stuff for fear
of being scratched and getting their clothing torn
to ribbons. Even as it was, the most substantial
of the uniforms worn by the engineers did not
last very long, and had to be replaced.</p>

<p>The abandoned mines were spread over a large
area, and because of the war were in such condition
that only a small portion of the various passageways
were used by the Americans. The engineers
had their quarters in one long passageway,
which some one had named The Subway, while
some of the infantry were quartered not a long
distance off in what was known as The Tube.</p>

<p>These quarters were, as the chums had agreed,
perfectly safe from bombardment by the enemy.
But they were rather damp and chilly, and were
invaded by hordes of mine rats with which the
troops had constant battles.</p>

<p>“My gracious! I don’t know but that the rats
are just about as bad as the cooties,” cried Phil,
one day after one of the rodents had run over
him while he was trying to take a nap.</p>

<p>“Don’t say a word about the cooties!” Ben
returned, scratching his back on one of the upright
posts in the mine. “I never thought I was going
to be subject to anything like this when I joined
the army.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“Oh, forget it and look pleasant!” cried Dave,
who sat on a box mending a shirt by the light of a
candle. He, too, had had his dose of these little
pests, which seemed to have descended upon all
the armies like a plague.</p>

<p>Two things were in the engineers’ favor—the
Germans seemed to have withdrawn from that
vicinity and the weather remained unusually fine.
At night there was a full moon which bathed the
country for miles around in beauty.</p>

<p>Dave had put in a hard day’s work, and in addition
had been asked to go on an errand by Captain
Obray, who had left an important notebook at
one of the headquarters he had visited. This
notebook the young lieutenant was now carrying
in one of his pockets.</p>

<p>“If it wasn’t for those guns banging away in
the distance one would never know a war was
on by looking at such a scene as this,” remarked
Dave, on this evening, as he walked toward the
mine entrance with Roger and some of the others.</p>

<p>“It certainly is beautiful,” was the reply of the
senator’s son. “Almost too nice to retire.
Wish we were at Crumville with the girls.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll stay out a while,” went on Dave.
“I’ve got nothing particular to do. Do you want
to take a little walk with me?”</p>

<p>“I’ve promised myself to write a letter to my
folks, Dave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“And I’m going to write a letter, too,” added
Phil. “Belle complained the last time that my
letter was very short. This time I’ll make it long
enough, believe me!”</p>

<p>“I wrote two letters yesterday; so I think I’ll
take a little walk,” said Dave. “I’ll be back in
an hour or so.”</p>

<p>His chums retired into one of the openings of
the abandoned mine, and Dave turned to walk
along a trail which led through the woods. Here
at one point between a number of rocks, he had
located a spring of pure water and he thought to
get a drink.</p>

<p>The moonlight filtering through the trees made
many objects appear rather ghostly, but, as my
old readers know, Dave was not one to scare
easily, and he walked onward at a brisk pace. Of
course he kept his eyes and ears wide open, for
he had no desire to be surprised. He did not
carry a gun, for in that vicinity there seemed to
be no use for firearms.</p>

<p>Although he knew nothing of what had been
plotted by Max Gebauer and Nat Poole, Dave,
since coming to the abandoned mines, had been
constantly watched by those two unworthies.
Now Gebauer noted with great satisfaction that
Dave was taking a walk by himself in the semi-darkness.
He at once sped away to notify his
crony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“Come on, Nat! Now is our chance,” he said
in a low voice.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Dave Porter is taking a walk by himself in
the woods.”</p>

<p>“What do you propose to do?”</p>

<p>“Let us follow him. Maybe we’ll get a chance
to square accounts.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what we can do if he is just walking
in the woods,” said Nat. “Of course, we
could both jump on him and give him a good
beating.”</p>

<p>“Something may develop. Come on before he
gets out of sight.”</p>

<p>Nat was willing, and side by side the pair hurried
off in the direction our hero had taken.</p>

<p>Reaching the spring, Dave procured a drink of
water, refilled his canteen, and then proceeded on
his way. The road led up to the top of a small
hill, and here he thought he might get a good view
of the surrounding country in the moonlight.</p>

<p>While on the way Dave paused once or twice to
look around him. When he did this Gebauer and
Nat lost no time in dropping flat on the ground
just as if they were making a night sortie into No
Man’s Land. As a consequence, our hero did
not become aware that he was being followed.</p>

<p>When Dave reached what he thought was the
top of the hill he was rather surprised to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
himself among some rather rough rocks and a
large quantity of loose stones and dirt. Then he
made a discovery, which filled him with wonder.
A series of nest-holes for artillery had been constructed
on the top of the hill, evidently by the
Germans. But there were no evidences of field-pieces
having been used there, so Dave came to
the conclusion that the enemy had changed their
plans after the nests had been made.</p>

<p>There were eight of the openings, and having
walked to the last of them the young engineer
made another discovery. Here there was a wide
trench running downward into a cave-like opening.
What was beyond, he could only surmise.</p>

<p>“It looks to me as if that slope leads down
into some part of the abandoned mines,” he told
himself. “This is worth investigating. I’ll have
to report to the captain and we’ll have to see what
it looks like in the daytime.”</p>

<p>In the moonlight the opening underground
looked quite forbidding, and Dave did not venture
very far into it. He did, however, examine the
ground as closely as possible to see if he could
find any recent footprints. But nothing of the
sort came to light. Evidently no one had been
in that vicinity since the last rain, which had occurred
more than a week before.</p>

<p>As our hero was bending over to make sure
that there were no traces of footsteps around this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
entrance to the abandoned mines, the notebook
which Captain Obray had entrusted to him slipped
from his pocket, falling between some of the loose
rocks.</p>

<p>“Hello! it won’t do for me to lose that notebook,”
Dave told himself. “I should have delivered
it before I went on this walk.”</p>

<p>Dave had just straightened up with the notebook
in his hand when he suddenly became aware
of two figures close behind him. Each was armed
with a heavy stick, and before he could make a
move to defend himself he received a stinging
blow on the head. He gave a cry of pain, and
then two other blows descended upon him and
he knew no more.</p>

<p>Having assaulted him in such a dastardly fashion,
Gebauer and Nat stood over their victim for
several seconds expecting him to make some sort
of move. But as he did not, the youth from
Crumville became alarmed.</p>

<p>“Gee! you don’t suppose we knocked him out,
do you?” he whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” answered Gebauer coolly.
“He’s partly senseless, that’s all. He’ll come
around presently.”</p>

<p>“That was an awful crack you gave him on the
head!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hit him any harder than you did,
Nat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“You did so! I only gave him a slight tap,
and you hit him hard twice.”</p>

<p>“See here! You can’t put this off on me,” said
the lieutenant fiercely. “Just the same, I don’t
think he’s hurt very much.” He bent over and
took a look at Dave. “He’s breathing all right.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad of that!” returned the money
lender’s son, with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>While he was speaking Lieutenant Gebauer had
picked up the notebook which had again fallen
between the rocks, and placed it in his pocket.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded Nat.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I’ll have to examine it when
we get to the light. Here, Nat, take hold of him.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do.”</p>

<p>“Let us place him in that opening yonder.
There is no use of leaving him out here in the
open.”</p>

<p>“But he might drop down into the mine if we
place him too near one of the shafts,” remonstrated
Nat. He was beginning to get a little
frightened over what had been done.</p>

<p>“What do we care if he does drop down?”
answered the other brutally. “Come on, before
he comes to his senses.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to go too far into this,” whined
Nat. He was feeling more and more uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“You promised to see it through, and you’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
got to do it,” declared Lieutenant Gebauer.
“Come! Catch hold!”</p>

<p>Between them they carried Dave into the cave-like
opening. Then, as Nat retreated, fearing
that our hero would recover consciousness and
recognize him, Gebauer lit a match and took a
survey of the situation. Only a few feet away
was a slope leading down to unknown depths.
The fellow who had tried to become Dave’s rival
in the affections of Jessie Wadsworth hesitated
for an instant and then pushed our hero’s body
toward this slope. Then he gave it another
shove, and suddenly saw the body go turning over
and over down the slope and out of sight into the
darkness.</p>

<p>“There, I guess that will fix you, Dave
Porter!” he muttered to himself. “You’ll have
one sweet job getting out of that hole. I hope
it takes you several days to do it. And if it does,
I think it will be an easy matter to spread a report
that you ran away simply to have a good time
in one of the French towns behind us.”</p>

to me?”</p>

<p>This was the first thought that coursed slowly
through Dave’s mind as he gradually returned to
consciousness. He lay perfectly still, not moving
for several minutes.</p>

<p>All was pitch dark around him, and by the way
his whole body hurt he knew he had been tumbled
over some rocks. He put his hand to his head
and found quite a swelling there. Then his
fingers traveled to his left temple and felt something
sticky, which he knew was blood that had
started to congeal.</p>

<p>Presently a faint recollection of what had occurred
crossed his mind. He remembered stooping
to pick up the notebook belonging to Captain
Obray and then catching a flitting glimpse of two
figures behind him. Then had fallen several
blows upon his head, and he had gone down in a
heap.</p>

<p>“Maybe they were a couple of Germans who
attacked me,” he reasoned. “Perhaps I am their
prisoner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>But then he remembered something else, which
was that even in that passing glimpse of his assailants
he had noted that they wore khaki and not
the grey of the enemy.</p>

<p>“They were two of our own fellows,” he told
himself. He knew he had no enemies among the
engineers, and his mind at once reverted to Lieutenant
Gebauer and Nat Poole. Would they be
mean enough to make such an attack?</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem possible! And yet, if they
didn’t do it, who did?” was our hero’s thought.</p>

<p>But now was no time for further speculation
on the subject. Dave felt that he must find out
where he was and do what he could to get back
to the engineers’ quarters. He did not know how
long he had been unconscious, but thought it must
have been for some time, possibly an hour or two.</p>

<p>He lay on some sloping rocks, and it was not
without considerable difficulty that he arose to his
feet. As he did this he felt in his pocket for
Captain Obray’s notebook and discovered that it
was gone.</p>

<p>“I remember now I didn’t have time to pick
it up,” he told himself. “Hang the luck, anyway!
If those fellows went off with that notebook,
what will the captain say? He told me it
was very valuable. I suppose it must have some
of our specifications in it.”</p>

<p>Dave had brought neither a weapon nor a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
pocket flashlight with him. He, however, had a
waterproof match-safe, and this was about half
full of matches. Bringing one of these forth, he
struck it on the rocks with care, and then, as the
small light flared up, he took a look at his surroundings.</p>

<p>He was in a long, low passageway of the abandoned
mines. To one side of him was a V-shaped
opening. One passageway of this opening was
very rocky and at one point had a sudden descent
of ten or twelve feet. The other passageway
sloped upward at considerable less of an angle.</p>

<p>“I guess I must have come down that passageway
on the right,” he reasoned, “because if I had
come down the other way more than likely I would
have broken my neck.”</p>

<p>Dave was mistaken in his reasoning, and that
mistake cost him dear, as we shall presently see.
He had really come down the rougher way of
the two, and that he had not lost his life in the
fall was certainly miraculous.</p>

<p>The young lieutenant counted his matches and
found he had seven left.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to be very careful of those,” he told
himself. “It would be awful to be lost down
here in the dark. Why, if that happened I might
never find my way out!”</p>

<p>This possibility caused him to become very
grave and thoughtful, and without lighting another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
match he crawled upward along the passageway
which he had noted and which he thought
must be the way by which to get out of that part
of the abandoned mines.</p>

<p>With nothing to guide him, our hero’s progress
was necessarily slow. He had to feel ahead every
foot for fear of knocking his head on some of
the rocks.</p>

<p>But even though his matches were few, Dave
would have done better had he lit one of them and
surveyed his surroundings again before proceeding
further. As it was, he was just thinking of
coming to a halt to make up his mind what was
best to do next when suddenly his foot came in
contact with nothing more substantial than air.
He made a wild clutch to save himself, but the
next instant slid down and down over some rocks
and loose dirt, coming finally to a halt with a shock
that knocked nearly all the breath from his body.</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar, that was some tumble!” he
muttered, after he had somewhat recovered.
“I’ve got to make a light, and that is all there is
to it. If I don’t, I may break my neck down
here.”</p>

<p>In his pocket Dave kept a packet of letters
which he had received from Jessie. He could
not bring himself to think of burning the letters,
but took each out of its envelope and stowed them
safely in his bosom once more. Then he tore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
the envelopes apart, and made of each a long,
curled taper. Having done this, he lit one.</p>

<p>He discovered what had happened. At some
time or other, probably while the mines were
in operation, a shaft had been cut from one gallery
to that at a lower depth. This shaft was a
sloping one, and he had rolled down to its bottom.</p>

<p>To get back to the upper level did not look
easy, and after Dave had tried it several times
he looked about for some other means of getting
out of the abandoned mines.</p>

<p>Presently our hero reached a point which filled
him with encouragement. He came out upon a
much larger passageway, and there saw the remains
of a small railroad track, one which had evidently
been used for mine cars.</p>

<p>“This track must lead out into the open air,”
he reasoned. “I remember seeing one of the
tracks around the mines the first day we came to
this vicinity.”</p>

<p>Alongside of the track Dave found some bits
of wood and dried brush, and he lost no time in
fixing himself a sort of torch by tying some of
the brush to a stick with a bit of string he chanced
to be carrying in his pocket.</p>

<p>Armed with the torch, he set off along the mine
track and followed this for a considerable distance.
Then he came to where the track branched
in two directions, and once more came to a halt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
Which track to pursue he did not know, and consulting
his pocket compass did not help him in
solving the problem. Finally he concluded to follow
the track on the right, and so continued his
journey underground.</p>

<p>He had gone but a short distance when he came
upon a decidedly gruesome object. This was the
body of a dead German soldier huddled up in a
heap among the rocks. The fellow had been dead
for some time, probably weeks, if not months, and
our hero lost no time in putting distance between
himself and this awful reminder of the realities
of war.</p>

<p>At last he felt he ought to be near one of the
openings of the abandoned mines. The track
was now much broken, and a short distance further
came to an end at a point where several other
galleries crossed that in which he was traveling.</p>

<p>“Here’s a fine state of affairs,” he murmured
to himself. “Now what’s to be done?”</p>

<p>It must be admitted that Dave was growing
somewhat alarmed. The blows on the head and
the tumble he had taken a short while before had
weakened him, and he could hardly keep his feet.</p>

<p>He opened his canteen and took several swallows
of water, and also bathed his forehead.
This refreshed him for the time being; and he
moved on again, this time taking a passageway
which pointed southward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>“If I keep on moving southward I’m bound
to get out of this old mine sooner or later,” was
the way he reasoned. “And I’ll be coming out
somewhere in the vicinity of our quarters.”</p>

<p>But the passageways of the abandoned mines
were by no means straight, and soon our hero became
so mixed up that he did not know which way
to turn. He tried to get back to the gallery where
the track was located, thinking to follow it in the
opposite direction. But now the track had vanished
completely.</p>

<p>At last he had to sit down and rest. He wondered
if it was still dark outside.</p>

<p>“If I only had my watch to tell the time by,”
he mused. He had not yet replaced the timepiece
which had been lost.</p>

<p>The day’s work and the subsequent events had
so exhausted our hero that at last he concluded
he had better lie down and rest. As he progressed
he had picked up several sticks of wood
and some more dry brush, and this he placed
beside him so that he might have it ready for use
if needed. Then by the dying flare of the torch
he was using he managed to arrange something
of a couch at the side of the gallery, and there
lay down. He thought he would not be able to
sleep, but after lying there for the best part of
half an hour he dropped off into troubled slumber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>When the young lieutenant awoke it was still
as dark as ever around him. He lost no time
in fixing himself another torch, and, feeling hungry,
ate a portion of the emergency ration he
carried, washing it down with a few swallows of
water.</p>

<p>As he advanced he noticed that the passageway
he was following sloped gradually upward,
and this gave him some encouragement.</p>

<p>“If it keeps on going up it certainly ought to
come out into the open air sooner or later,” was
the way the young officer reasoned.</p>

<p>He had gone but a short distance further when
a sound came to his ears which filled him with surprise.
There was a sharp bark, followed by several
others.</p>

<p>“Dogs—or else foxes!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The sounds came closer, and holding up his
torch Dave made out the forms of two lean and
hungry-looking dogs. At first he thought they
might belong to some Red Cross contingent, but
soon threw this idea to the winds.</p>

<p>“They are just stray dogs, and pretty wild
and hungry at that,” he told himself. “I wish
they hadn’t come this way. I don’t like their
looks at all.”</p>

<p>The dogs had evidently scented him, and now
they came closer, barking furiously and showing
their teeth. Evidently they, too, were lost underground,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
and most likely had not had food for some
time.</p>

<p>“Get out of there, you beggars!” cried Dave,
as the dogs came still closer, snapping and snarling
at him.</p>

<p>He stuck out his torch, and both animals leaped
back. But then they began to circle around, as
if to attack him from the rear. This was a new
peril, and one which Dave realized might prove
grave. The dogs were large, and if really starving
they might do their best to lay him low.</p>

<p>With the torch in his left hand, Dave gathered
up a stone and threw it with all force at one of
the beasts. It took the dog in the side, and he
leaped back, yelping with pain. Then Dave
threw another stone at the other dog, catching
him in one of his forelegs. Then he made a
leap as if to thrust the torch into the dogs’ faces,
and in sudden panic the two animals turned tail
and fled down one of the galleries of the mine.</p>

<p>Having thus got rid of the dogs, at least for the
time being, the young lieutenant continued on his
course. He kept his eyes open for more brushwood,
or anything with which he might make a
torch, but without avail. He lit the last stick he
was carrying with a heavy heart. What should
he do when that was consumed?</p>

<p>An hour later found our hero in anything but a
satisfied state of mind. He had traveled one gallery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
after another of the abandoned mines, and
hardly knew how to turn or what to do next. The
idea of being thus buried underground was horrible.
Then, of a sudden, came a change. He
reached a turn of a passageway, and far ahead saw
a streak of light.</p>

<p>“An opening at last!” he cried joyously, and
his heart gave a bound of delight. He fairly
ran forward, so eager was he to get out into the
open air once more.</p>

<p>And then almost before he realized it the unexpected
happened.</p>

<p>Dave found himself close to one of the openings
of the abandoned mines, but at a point which
was a long distance from the quarters of the engineers.
Although he did not know it, he had traveled
for several miles under the hills in that vicinity.</p>

<p>“Who goes there?” shouted a voice in German;
and a minute later the young lieutenant
found himself surrounded by half a dozen of the
enemy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>LOOKING FOR DAVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I wonder</span> why Dave doesn’t come back?”</p>

<p>“He must have taken quite a walk, Roger.”</p>

<p>“I should think, Phil, that he would be too
tired to go very far; we’ve had quite a strenuous
day, if you’ll remember.”</p>

<p>“I don’t have to remember! My back keeps
reminding me of it all the while,” said the shipowner’s
son. “I’ll tell you what—being a working
engineer in the army is no fool of a job!”</p>

<p>The two chums had finished the letters they had
spoken of writing, and along with several of the
others were taking their ease in that portion of
the abandoned mines which had been turned over
to them for quarters. Not far away Ben and
Buster were sitting beside a small nail keg, playing
a game of checkers on a home-made board
with some French coins for men. Close at hand
sat Shadow, telling one of his innumerable stories
to some of the other engineers.</p>

<p>“What do you say if we go out and meet him?”
remarked Roger, after a pause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“Suits me,” responded Phil. And a moment
later they were on their way.</p>

<p>Outside the moon still shone brightly, so that
objects could be seen for quite a distance. They
looked up and down the path through the trees,
but, of course, saw nothing of the young lieutenant.</p>

<p>Presently an officer approached them who
proved to be Captain Obray.</p>

<p>“Out a little late, aren’t you?” said the captain
pleasantly, as they saluted. “I thought all
you fellows were pining for sleep after such a
hard day’s work.”</p>

<p>“We came out to look for Lieutenant Porter,”
answered Roger.</p>

<p>“I’m looking for him myself,” said the captain
in some surprise.</p>

<p>He was after the notebook which our hero had
promised to get for him. This notebook contained
several plans and specifications which were
of importance. The captain had left the notebook
at headquarters, and knowing that Dave
had gone there to make a report, had requested
him to get it.</p>

<p>“He came out for a walk, leaving us to write
some letters,” remarked Phil. “But he ought to
be back by this time, unless he went a long distance,
and I shouldn’t think he would do that
after such a day’s work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“Have you any idea which way he took?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say anything about it, but I rather
imagine he walked up through the woods to that
spring we located there,” answered Roger. “If
you don’t mind, Captain, we’ll go up there and
take a look around.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you,” answered the captain.
And then he added suddenly: “I don’t know
but what it might be well for you to take your
guns along.”</p>

<p>“Do you think there are any Germans in this
vicinity?”</p>

<p>“It’s possible. They may be sending out some
night raiding parties, you know, through some
openings of the mines.”</p>

<p>The two young engineers ran back to their
quarters and soon returned armed. The captain
carried his pistol; and thus the three walked
through the woods until they reached the spring.
Here they saw where some of the water had been
splashed around on the otherwise dry rocks, showing
that somebody had been there not so very
long before.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad we can’t call him,” said Phil.
But this was against the regulations, no loud cries
of any kind being tolerated during the night.
Had they given such a cry it would have been taken
at once for an alarm, and this would have caused
a commotion throughout the entire camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>The three walked on past the spring and presently
came close to the hill up which Dave had
climbed. But here they saw no evidences of the
missing lieutenant, and at last turned back to their
quarters.</p>

<p>“I must say, Captain, I don’t like this at all,”
said Roger.</p>

<p>“Neither do I, Sergeant. Unless Lieutenant
Porter went off on some special mission, it looks
to me as if something bad may have happened
to him.”</p>

<p>“Do you think the Germans would dare to
come so far behind our lines?”</p>

<p>“They might if they thought they saw a chance
of capturing some of our men. It’s bad to have so
many mine openings around.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope Dave hasn’t been captured!” cried
Phil, in dismay.</p>

<p>With heavy hearts the three returned to their
separate quarters. As soon as Captain Obray
had left them, Roger and Phil acquainted their
chums with what had occurred.</p>

<p>“Dave missing! You don’t mean it!” exclaimed
Ben, and his face showed his concern.</p>

<p>“What in the world do you suppose could have
happened to him?” asked Buster.</p>

<p>“If any of the Heinies are on a raiding party
we had better get prepared for them,” was
Shadow’s comment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>They talked the matter over for fully an hour,
but without arriving at any satisfactory conclusion.
The disappearance of Dave worried all
of them a good deal, and it was a long while
before any of them got to sleep, Roger and Phil
being unusually restless.</p>

<p>“Gee! if the Germans have captured Dave,
however are we going to tell his folks?” was the
way the shipowner’s son expressed himself.</p>

<p>“And how are we going to tell Jessie Wadsworth?”
added Roger. “Oh, it just makes me
sick to think of it!”</p>

<p>All of the young engineers were up at an early
hour, and they readily received permission to go
on a hunt for their missing chum. Captain Obray,
however, cautioning them to be careful and not
expose themselves needlessly to the enemy.</p>

<p>The search for Dave lasted the best part of
the morning. During that time they visited not
only the vicinity of the spring, but also came close
to the spot where the young lieutenant had been
knocked senseless. But they saw nothing which
threw any light on what had occurred.</p>

<p>“Beats the Dutch what has become of him!”
sighed Ben, after they had walked up and down
through the woods and along the hills in that
vicinity.</p>

<p>“Looks almost as if the earth had opened and
swallowed him,” said Buster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“Say! do you suppose it’s possible he broke
through to one of the openings of the mines?”
questioned Phil.</p>

<p>“That might be possible, Phil,” answered
Roger. “Just the same, if it did happen, it’s
queer we don’t find some evidence of it. If Dave
went merely for a walk, it isn’t likely he left this
path, and we have searched every foot of that
several times.”</p>

<p>Much discouraged, the young engineers returned
to the camp and made a report to their
superiors. Captain Obray shook his head seriously.</p>

<p>“It certainly looks bad,” he mused. “I’ll have
to list the lieutenant as missing.”</p>

<p>The others did not feel much like going to
work, but there were a number of things that had
to be done. The news soon spread throughout
the entire engineering camp, and Frank Andrews
and a number of others who had known Dave
intimately were much affected.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t go away like this on his own
account,” said Andrews. “Something undoubtedly
happened to him.”</p>

<p>“And that something couldn’t have been anything
good,” returned Roger.</p>

<p>As soon as the young engineers were through
with their work for the afternoon they started
on another hunt for Dave, this time being accompanied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
by Frank Andrews and several of the
older engineers. Every foot of the woods in that
vicinity was gone over, including a portion of the
hill which Dave had ascended.</p>

<p>“Here are some footprints,” said Frank Andrews
presently, as he pointed to some marks in
the soft soil near where Dave had been thrown
down.</p>

<p>They examined this locality with great care,
and presently Phil picked up a uniform button.</p>

<p>“That shows one of our men was up here,”
declared the shipowner’s son. “It’s an American
button.”</p>

<p>“It may be one of Dave’s,” answered Frank
Andrews, after looking the button over.</p>

<p>They soon came to the opening down which
Dave had been shoved. But here nothing greeted
their eyes which looked suspicious.</p>

<p>“It’s possible he may have slipped down into
just such a hole as that,” remarked Roger.</p>

<p>“But why should he? No fellow would do
it with his eyes wide open,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“But it was night-time,” suggested Shadow.</p>

<p>“That’s true; but it was moonlight. And besides,
if Dave slipped into any place like that,
I’ll bet he would soon pull himself out.”</p>

<p>There seemed nothing more to do, and with
hearts that were heavier than ever they returned
to their quarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>On the following day Phil went out on an
errand which took him past the infantry command
to which Gebauer and Nat Poole belonged. He
saw Nat sitting on a fallen tree. The money
lender’s son looked anything but cheerful. Phil
at first thought of passing the young soldier, but
suddenly wheeled around.</p>

<p>“Hello, Nat!” he called out, as pleasantly as
he could.</p>

<p>“Hello, yourself!” was the surly response.</p>

<p>“Say, Nat, have you heard the news about
Dave Porter?” questioned Phil.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about? I haven’t
heard anything,” answered the money lender’s son
in a nervous, high-pitched voice.</p>

<p>“Dave went out the other evening for a walk,
and he hasn’t returned. I don’t suppose you have
seen or heard anything of him?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen anything of Dave Porter! I
don’t know anything about him!” Nat’s manner
showed his agitation. “Why should you come to
me about him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought you might be interested. His
disappearance is worrying us a good deal.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Perhaps he got scared and deserted.”</p>

<p>“You know better than to talk that way, Nat,”
replied Phil sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>“I mean maybe he went back to one of those
French towns to have a good time for a day or
two,” continued the money lender’s son.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk like a fool! You know Dave
Porter would never break away like that. His
disappearance has a serious side to it, although
what, we don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you know all about it, why do you
bother me?” went on Nat, looking more sour
than ever.</p>

<p>“Nat Poole, if I had your disposition I’d go
down to the river and drown myself!” declared
the shipowner’s son in disgust. “Dave is right
from your home town, and he’s as good a fellow
as there is in the world. And even though he
did give you what you deserved, you ought to have
some interest when he is missing and may be in
serious trouble. For all we know, he may be
a prisoner of the Germans.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about him—and I
don’t care!” said Nat, and jumped up from the
log upon which he was sitting and walked away.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, Nat was very much disturbed,
and he hurried away, fearing that Phil might discover
his state of mind. He and Gebauer had
kept track of matters, and early that morning had
learned that our hero was still missing.</p>

<p>“I wonder what will happen if he never turns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
up?” thought Nat, as he walked back to his quarters.
The very idea that Dave might never return
caused him to shiver.</p>

<p>A little later Nat ran into Gebauer and, motioning
the lieutenant to one side, told him of the
interview with Phil.</p>

<p>“I hope you didn’t give yourself away!” cried
Gebauer quickly.</p>

<p>“Trust me for that,” answered the money
lender’s son. “Just the same, Max, I think you
carried things too far.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> carried things? <i>You</i>, you mean!” answered
the lieutenant quickly.</p>

<p>“See here! You’re not going to stick it off
on me like that,” stormed Nat. “It was you
who gave him the crack that knocked him senseless.”</p>

<p>“Sh-sh! Not so loud!” interrupted Gebauer,
and placed a hasty hand over his companion’s
mouth. “Somebody might hear you!”</p>

<p>“Well then, don’t say I’m to blame.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let’s talk about that now.” Gebauer
drew a deep breath. “I’m glad Lawrence mentioned
the state of affairs to you. Now they
won’t think it’s strange that we know all about it.”</p>

<p>“But suppose he never returns?” questioned
Nat hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll get back some time or other.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“I’m sure he will. Just tumbling him down
into that mine can’t have hurt him so very much.”</p>

<p>“But he might have gone down into some terribly
deep hole.”</p>

<p>“I think you’ll find Dave Porter turning up
safe and sound sooner or later. Just the same,
I guess we had better not say anything about having
seen him on his way to one of the towns in
the rear,” continued Gebauer.</p>

<p>“Why not? I thought that was part of your
scheme to get him into trouble.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve changed my mind about it, Nat.
You see, it’s this way: If we were positive that
he would show himself in a day or two, we might
spread such a report. But if he doesn’t turn up,
then they would be sure to come to us and ask
for all particulars, and that might prove very
embarrassing. So I guess for the present we had
better say nothing.”</p>

<p>“What did you do with that notebook you
picked up?”</p>

<p>“I put that away.”</p>

<p>“You had better place it where no one can find
it, Max. If it was found among your things it
might be used as evidence against us.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got it in a safe place, so don’t worry.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we ought to go on a hunt for
him ourselves?” continued Nat, after an unsatisfactory
pause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“What do you mean? Go down into that
shaft of the abandoned mines?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Not on your life! I wouldn’t go down there
for a thousand dollars,” answered Gebauer
quickly. The very thought of going down into
that dark place to look for his victim caused him
to shudder.</p>

<p>“Somehow I think we ought to do something,”
continued Nat. He was feeling more and more
uncomfortable as he realized the awful possibilities
attached to their actions.</p>

<p>“We’ll lie low and say nothing!” answered
the lieutenant firmly. “You keep your mouth
tight shut. If those friends of Porter’s come to
you and try to pump you, beware of them. If
they got an inkling of what we did, we would
certainly be in bad.” And then Gebauer looked
at Nat in such a fierce way that it struck terror
to the slacker’s very soul.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>A PRISONER OF THE ENEMY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As soon</span> as Dave saw the Germans he attempted
to retreat, but they were too quick for him, and in
a few seconds six of the enemy had surrounded
him while several more were running in that direction.</p>

<p>As we know, the young lieutenant was unarmed,
so resistance was out of the question. Several
of the Germans pointed their rifles at him, and
then there was nothing left for him to do but throw
up his hands in token of surrender.</p>

<p>“Watch him, you Kopek and Posen,” said an
under officer, in German. “There may be more
coming.”</p>

<p>The two soldiers addressed pushed Dave
roughly to one side in an angle of the wall, and
there one of them held him at the point of a
bayonet. In the meantime, the other Germans,
under the leadership of the officer, spread out
across the passageway of the mine. Some even
ran a distance ahead, peering this way and that
along the dark passageways.</p>

<p>Presently the officer came back, accompanied by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
one of his men, a fellow who had lived for some
time in London and who could speak fairly good
English.</p>

<p>“Haf you been all alone?” demanded this
soldier, after having received a request for this
information from his superior.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am all alone,” answered Dave.</p>

<p>“How did you come by this part of the mine?”
was the next question put.</p>

<p>Dave saw no reason for deceiving those who
had made him a prisoner, and in a straightforward
manner he told of having rolled down through an
opening in the mines some distance off, and then
related how he had wandered around, met the
savage dogs, and finally come out into daylight
at this point. The German listened attentively,
and from time to time translated what our hero
said for the benefit of the others.</p>

<p>“And you wass sure you been all alone?” was
the next question.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>No more questions were asked just then, but a
number of the Germans were detailed to watch
for any signs of approaching Americans. Then
Dave was placed in the charge of two of the men
and told to march.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_p228a">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p228a.jpg" alt="One of them held him at the point of a bayonet">

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The young lieutenant wondered if he had come
out of the mines at a point which was near the
German lines. He saw only about fifteen soldiers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>and nothing that looked like a trench or a dugout,
and concluded that this was simply a reconnoitring
party making its way through the woods and over
the rough rocks, probably with some idea of “feeling
out” that portion of the American front.</p>

<p>Presently the party came to where they had to
cross a small stream. Before this was done Dave
was halted and the soldier who could speak English
addressed him.</p>

<p>“You not make any noise now, or you get
killed,” he ordered, and the look on his face
showed that he meant what he said.</p>

<p>With these men ready either to shoot or stab
him at an instant’s notice, Dave felt that it would
be foolhardy to make any noise or attempt to
escape. Consequently he silently crossed the
small stream with them and walked along a trail
leading through some thick brushwood. Thus
they covered a good quarter of a mile, presently
reaching open ground beyond which were a number
of German trenches.</p>

<p>The appearance of the American prisoner was
hailed with delight by a gathering of German
soldiers, all of whom eyed Dave curiously.</p>

<p>“American—and a lieutenant at that!” cried
one. “Some catch!”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Oswald will get some credit now,”
returned another.</p>

<p>“The Yankee pig ought to be shot down!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
What is the sense of making a prisoner of him?”
cried a third. “The Americans had no business
to come into this war!”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, Carl—they will treat him
rough enough!” exclaimed the first soldier who
had spoken. Then he picked up a lump of dirt
and hurled it at Dave, striking him in the leg.</p>

<p>“He’ll be useful to get some information
from,” remarked another soldier. “A lieutenant
like that ought to know a good deal.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe the Americans know anything!”
cried still another. “They are a lot of
numskulls! They had no business to get into this
war!”</p>

<p>After a short pause at the trenches Dave was
marched to the rear, of the lines. Here, to his
surprise, he was joined by two other Americans,
both privates.</p>

<p>“Hello! where are you from?” he questioned
quickly, after both of the other prisoners had
saluted him and he had saluted in return.</p>

<p>One man, whose name was Oscar Davis, was
from New York State, and the other, named Ralph
Thompson, was from Massachusetts. Both were
young fellows of about Dave’s age, and both were
as mad as hornets because they had been captured.</p>

<p>“I was out in a night raid with twenty others,”
explained Oscar Davis. “We got along pretty
well until all of a sudden Jerry began to throw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
up some star shells and flaming onions. Then I
and two other fellows were spotted by the Fritzies,
and both of the other fellows were killed.
Then something hit me in the back and knocked
me over on my head, so that I was partly stunned.
When I got so I could do some thinking these
fellows had me and they fairly dragged me over
to their trench.”</p>

<p>Ralph Thompson proved to be an American
aviator. He had been up in a small machine doing
special work when a storm had come up and
one of the planes of his machine had suddenly
broken. He had tried to get back behind the
American lines, but the storm had been too much
for him, and he had come down with a crash
directly on top of one of the German dugouts.
There had been a grand commotion, the Germans
thinking that the dugout had been struck by a
shell. He had set fire to his machine, as was
the custom, but before he could make his escape
had been surrounded and captured.</p>

<p>“And now I suppose we are in for a dandy
time—not,” he concluded dismally.</p>

<p>“You can be thankful you weren’t killed when
your plane collapsed,” returned Dave; and then
told something about himself.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose they will do with us?”
questioned Oscar Davis anxiously. He was a tall,
thin youth, and later on let out that he had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
year before graduated from Harvard University.</p>

<p>“I suppose we’re booked for one of their prison
camps,” answered Dave.</p>

<p>Then several of the Germans came up and
made motions that they should keep quiet.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that our hero was much
downcast. He had read and heard a great deal
of how inhumanly the Huns were treating all of
their prisoners. Only a few days before word
had reached the engineers of how several prisoners
had died in one of the detention camps
from lack of proper food and clothing.</p>

<p>“I suppose I’ve got to make the best of it,”
he thought philosophically. “Just the same, I’d
give a good deal to be back among our crowd
once more.”</p>

<p>About an hour later the three prisoners were
told to march, and were made to travel a distance
of several miles. At one point they were joined
by several other Americans and about a dozen
Canadians, and then the whole crowd continued
on its way to the rear.</p>

<p>The young lieutenant was hungry. He had already
eaten what was left of his emergency ration
and used up the water left in his canteen. But
no food was offered to him, and he had all he
could do to get a drink of water, the Germans
even seeming to begrudge him this comfort.</p>

<p>“They’re Huns, all right enough!” growled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
one of the Canadians, who chanced to be tramping
along just behind Dave. “We ought to wipe
every mother’s son of them off the face of the
earth!”</p>

<p>“Certainly not a very encouraging prospect,”
answered Dave.</p>

<p>“Silence!” came the sharp command from the
head of the column; and then followed some words
in German to the soldiers who had the prisoners
in charge. As a consequence Dave and a number
of others received jabs from the soldiers’
gun-butts, and one poor fellow who made a slight
resistance was promptly bowled over and stuck
through the side with a bayonet.</p>

<p>It was not until well toward nightfall that the
prisoners reached a small wire compound where
they were herded together like so many sheep.
This compound had been used by other prisoners
before them, and was in anything but a clean or
sanitary condition. They were thrust into the enclosure
in the most brutal fashion, and told they
would have to remain there until the next day.</p>

<p>“Don’t we get anything to eat?” questioned
Dave in broken German. He was beginning to
feel faint.</p>

<p>“Yes; you’ll get something in a little while,”
was the reply.</p>

<p>All of the prisoners had, of course, been disarmed
and searched, and many of their most valuable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
possessions had been taken from them.
The compound was heavily guarded, so that escape
was practically out of the question.</p>

<p>“It is nothing more than a big pig-pen!” was
the way Oscar Davis expressed himself.</p>

<p>“Well, you didn’t expect to have it look like a
New York City hotel, did you?” queried Dave,
with a faint grin.</p>

<p>“They might at least treat us like human beings!”</p>

<p>“I agree with you there.”</p>

<p>“If they don’t give me something to eat pretty
soon I’m going to try to make a break for it, even
if it costs me my life,” put in Ralph Thompson
recklessly. He had come from a rich family, and
previous to entering the army had been used to the
best of living.</p>

<p>“Don’t do anything foolish,” warned Dave.
“It won’t help you any, and it will only make it
so much the harder for the rest of us. By their
looks, some of those Huns wouldn’t like any better
fun than to shoot down every one of us.”</p>

<p>It was fully an hour before the prisoners were
given anything to eat, then each got a small tin
full of weak soup and a chunk of black bread.</p>

<p>“I can’t eat such chow as that,” declared one
of the prisoners after tasting the stuff. “Why,
it isn’t even respectable dish-water!” Nevertheless,
being very hungry, he managed at last to soak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
up his chunk of bread in the mess and devour it.</p>

<p>Dave was of the opinion that the food served
was decidedly poor, but it was better than nothing,
and he ate it without comment.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” remarked Ralph Thompson, “it’s
a little bit filling, and that’s something. I won’t
pull my belt any tighter until I am worse off.”</p>

<p>The next day the prisoners were joined by a
number of others, and all were marched still
further to the rear, arriving about noon at a
freight-yard on the outskirts of a small town.
Here were a number of box-cars, and the prisoners
were herded into these like so many cattle.</p>

<p>Over thirty men were in the car to which Dave
and the other Americans were assigned. The car
had only small slatted windows at either end.
After being given a couple of buckets of water the
door was closed and locked upon them.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how we are going to stand this,”
grumbled one of the prisoners. “Why, I can
hardly breathe now!” He was a short, thick-set
fellow, and consequently somewhat at a disadvantage
in that crowd.</p>

<p>Of course, every one wanted to get in the vicinity
of one of the slatted windows so that he might
get the benefit of what little fresh air was stirring.
The car had been used for the transportation
of cattle, and had not been cleaned.</p>

<p>“This certainly is the limit!” was Dave’s comment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
when he found himself squeezed into one
end of this place. “I wouldn’t treat a skunk like
this!”</p>

<p>Presently the train began to move, and the car
rattled out of the freight-yard and on its journey.
Previous to going aboard the prisoners had been
given some weak coffee, made mostly of acorns,
and some bread which several of the men declared
must be made of rye flour and sawdust.
And that was the only meal they had had since
morning.</p>

<p>“If they are going to starve us to death, they
might as well do it at once,” grumbled Davis.</p>

<p>“They’re either going to starve us or suffocate
us,” returned Thompson. The pair had struck
up quite an acquaintance.</p>

<p>On and on rattled the train, over switches and
bridges, and through many villages and towns.
Where they were bound, Dave could not imagine,
but he knew they must be getting deeper and
deeper into the heart of Germany, and this made
him more downcast than ever.</p>

<p>“I’ll have no chance to escape at all if they take
me too far away from the front lines,” he reasoned.
“Too bad! I almost wish I had made a dash
for it when I met those Germans at the entrance
to the mines.”</p>

<p>It was not until eight o’clock in the evening that
the train came to a stop and the doors were thrown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
open. By that time many of those within could
hardly stand upright, so weak were they from
want of fresh air and proper rest. They staggered
into the open, and were glad enough to
learn they were to receive another meal. This
time they were given a watery stew, made up partly
of potatoes and greens with a tiny piece of meat.
Accompanying the stew was the inevitable chunk
of black, sawdusty bread.</p>

<p>“A really elaborate menu, eh?” was Oscar
Davis’s sarcastic comment. “I hardly know what
to pick out on the bill-of-fare.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t eat too much,” returned Dave,
with a faint grin. “If you do that, you may get
indigestion.”</p>

<p>“Indigestion!” ejaculated the former university
student. “I think this mess is just the thing
to go back on a fellow’s stomach.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t be discouraged,” returned Dave
grimly. “It may be that the worst is yet to
come.”</p>

<p>In that surmise our hero was correct, as events
a little later proved.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>TRYING TO ESCAPE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day found Dave and about one hundred
prisoners herded in a long, low building which
had once been used as a horse-stable. It was
located at a place which had evidently been a fairgrounds,
for close behind were the remains of a
race-track and a grand-stand.</p>

<p>“I wonder how long we’ll have to stay in this
place?” grumbled Ralph Thompson.</p>

<p>“Pretty bum quarters, eh?” added Oscar
Davis.</p>

<p>“Anyway, it’s better than that cattle-car we
were herded in,” remarked Dave. “There are
more windows and we can get better air.”</p>

<p>That afternoon the young lieutenant was called
out and made to march to a military quarters not
far away. There he was asked his name and the
name of the command to which he belonged, and
then a great number of questions were put to him.
He answered as well as he could, taking care, of
course, that he did not give the enemy any information
of military value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>“You have evidently been well drilled concerning
what to say if captured,” remarked the questioner,
a burly German officer, as he glared at
Dave. “If you expect good treatment at our
hands you will have to loosen your tongue a little.”</p>

<p>“I have answered every question put to me,”
was our hero’s prompt reply.</p>

<p>“But you are keeping a whole lot of information
to yourself,” stormed the German officer.
“But we’ll get it out of you sooner or later, never
fear!” and then he ordered a couple of the guards
to take Dave back to the prison pen.</p>

<p>The other prisoners were also questioned one
by one. A few of them probably told more than
they should, doing this perhaps innocently, but
the majority were very close-mouthed, so much
so that their German questioners were anything
but pleased.</p>

<p>“These American swine think they can do as
they please,” grumbled one of the German officers.
“But just wait—we’ll show them what’s what!”</p>

<p>As a result of their holding back information
desired by the Huns, the prisoners were treated
with more severity than ever. Some of the windows
of the horse-stable were boarded up, and
their rations were cut down to such small portions
that even the most liberal-minded men in the
crowd demurred.</p>

<p>“This is positively inhuman!” declared one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
the Canadians. “It’s against the rules of war,
too!”</p>

<p>“England will have a big claim to settle against
Germany when this war is over,” declared another.</p>

<p>“I reckon Uncle Sam will have a claim, too,”
put in an American prisoner from Alabama.</p>

<p>Several days, including Sunday, were spent in
this prison pen, and then one morning, while it
was raining hard, one of the doors was opened
and a number of prisoners were told to come out
as their names were called.</p>

<p>“I guess they’re going to take us to some other
place,” remarked Dave. “I wonder where?”</p>

<p>“I hope it’s some better place than this,”
growled Oscar Davis.</p>

<p>Dave was among the first to be called out, and a
number of Americans and Canadians followed,
among them being Ralph Thompson. Oscar
Davis was left behind along with a number of
others, why, Dave could not surmise.</p>

<p>Without having a chance to say good-bye to
those left behind, about thirty of the prisoners
were marched away from the horse-stables to a
railroad station in a small German village. On
the way some boys and girls jeered at them, and
one old woman sifted some ashes down on their
heads from a second-story window.</p>

<p>Some of these ashes got into Dave’s eyes, almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
blinding him. He forgot for the instant where
he was walking, and did not realize the situation
until one of the guards hit him in the shoulder,
almost knocking him over. Had there been the
slightest chance of improving his condition
thereby, Dave would have leaped upon this guard
and pommeled him well. But he knew such an
action would have meant death, so he controlled
himself as best he could and continued on the
march.</p>

<p>At the railroad station they were herded into
a small freight-yard, and there received another
meal of watery soup and black bread. While
they were trying to eat this some of the town folks
came down to jeer at them and a few to hurl
sticks and stones.</p>

<p>“Being a prisoner is certainly no picnic,” remarked
Ralph Thompson.</p>

<p>“I know what I am going to do,” answered
Dave, in a low tone of voice. “I am going to
break away at the first opportunity that presents
itself.”</p>

<p>“They’ll shoot you down if they get the
chance.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care—let them shoot!” answered
the young lieutenant.</p>

<p>The inhuman treatment which had been accorded
him since his capture was beginning to
make him reckless. Where the Germans were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
going to send him next, he could not surmise, but
he felt certain they would place him at work, either
on one of their roads, or else in one of their
mines. There, he knew, he would be made to
labor ten or twelve hours a day on the scantiest
of food and in all sorts of weather.</p>

<p>“It’s enough to break down a mule,” he reasoned
to himself. “I’m not going to stand it!
I’m going to do what I can to escape at the very
first opportunity.”</p>

<p>All that day and the following night were spent
in the little freight-yard. During the darkness
the guards were increased, and electric lights were
made to illuminate the scene, so that escape was
out of the question. It still rained as hard as
ever.</p>

<p>Dave turned the matter over in his mind for
an hour or two, but finally gave it up and got
what little sleep he could sitting with his back
against some old railroad ties. Our hero, as
well as all of the other prisoners, was by this
time soaked to the skin, and many of the crowd
got heavy colds, from which one or two of them
did not recover.</p>

<p>It was not until after seven o’clock that evening
that a line of freight cars came rattling into
the yard. When it came to a standstill those in
the yard noted from the sounds that reached them
that more than three quarters of the cars were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
filled with prisoners. They begged for food and
water and fresh air, but the Germans having the
train in charge paid no attention to their appeals.</p>

<p>The prisoners in the yard were placed in two
cars, and this time Dave was separated from
Ralph Thompson. He was told to get into a car
which was partly filled with packing-cases. There
was room for just a dozen prisoners, and these
were herded together closely.</p>

<p>“These are smaller quarters than any yet,”
remarked one of the prisoners.</p>

<p>“But the car is fairly clean, and that is one
comfort,” said another.</p>

<p>“And we can use some of these packing-cases
to sit on,” added a third.</p>

<p>“I wonder if there is any grub in these boxes?”
ventured a fourth prisoner, after the door had
been closed and locked upon them. “If there is
anything to eat, I’m going to have it.”</p>

<p>Of course, it was quite dark in the car, but one
prisoner chanced to have a few matches, and one
of these was lit and the boxes hastily inspected.
They proved to contain pieces of small machinery,
much to the prisoners’ disgust.</p>

<p>“We can’t eat hardware,” was the way one of
them expressed himself.</p>

<p>One of the boxes had been left open, and Dave
used this for a seat. As the train bumped along,
making probably twenty-five or thirty miles an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
hour, he felt in the box and presently brought
out a small piece of machinery shaped something
like a jimmy.</p>

<p>As the train rattled on the young lieutenant
heard one prisoner ask another what time it was
and found out that it was close to ten o’clock in
the evening. The rain had stopped, but it was
still cloudy, with no stars showing themselves.</p>

<p>“If I could only get out of this car I might
have a chance to hide in some good place before
daylight,” Dave reasoned. “If the door was
open, I think I’d take a chance on jumping out,
even though this old train is running along at
fairly good speed.”</p>

<p>He was sitting not far from one of the doors
of the car, and now he examined this as best he
could in the darkness. Then he took the piece
of machinery in his hand and forced it between
the door and its frame.</p>

<p>“What are you trying to do there?” questioned
one of the other prisoners who was at his
side.</p>

<p>“I’m going to try to force this door open,”
answered our hero.</p>

<p>“What? And jump out in the darkness?
You’ll break your neck!” was the quick reply.</p>

<p>“I’ll see about what I’ll do after I get the
door open—if I can get it open,” answered the
young lieutenant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>Fortunately for our hero, the car was an old
one and the fastenings were rather dilapidated.
By using the piece of machinery as a jimmy, he
forced the edge of the door outwards until there
came a sudden snap which showed that the lock
had been broken. Then the lock fell away and
the door slid open with ease.</p>

<p>“Hello, somebody has opened the door!”
cried a voice in the darkness.</p>

<p>“That fresh air feels fine!”</p>

<p>“What’s doing there?” questioned somebody
else. “Are we going to get out?”</p>

<p>“I broke the door open with one of those
pieces of machinery,” answered Dave. “I don’t
intend to remain a prisoner any longer. I am
going to jump from this train at the very first
chance I get.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do it, lad! Don’t do it!” cried one
of the older men. “You’ll break your neck
sure!”</p>

<p>“And you can’t get away,” added another.
“The Germans will be sure to spot you in the
morning and they’ll shoot you down.”</p>

<p>To this Dave did not reply. Instead he peered
forth from the train, opening the door only a
few inches for that purpose.</p>

<p>All was dark, and for a minute or two he could
see but little. Then he made out that they were
passing through a patch of woods and that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
jagged rocks were numerous along the roadbed.</p>

<p>“I can’t jump out here,” he told himself. “I’d
either be killed or terribly cut up.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later the woods were left behind,
and then the prisoners found themselves
bumping over a railroad crossing. Then they
ran into a small station, which was lit up by smoky
lanterns.</p>

<p>“I guess this is my chance,” Dave told himself,
and the train had not yet come to a stop
when he pushed open the door a little farther
and allowed himself to drop out on the ground.
Then, as the train rolled a few yards further, he
made a quick leap for the shelter of some nearby
sheds.</p>

<p>The young lieutenant knew only too well that
it would be foolhardy to remain long in that vicinity.
The train had halted, and undoubtedly
some sort of inspection would be made of the
cars and the prisoners. The broken-open door
would be discovered, and then would come an
alarm.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to place distance between myself and
this place,” he murmured, and, watching his
chance, he sped along a line of low warehouses
and then took to some open fields beyond. He
kept on at his best rate of speed until he crossed
a road and then came to a patch of woods, evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
that through which the train had recently
passed.</p>

<p>By that time Dave was so out of wind he could
run no longer, and, finding a comfortable resting
place among the trees and bushes, he sat down and
gave himself over to his thoughts.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that his mind was by no
means at ease. He realized that in thus attempting
to escape he had taken his life in his hands.
Should the German guards make a search and
discover him, his life would probably pay the
forfeit.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to lie low in the daytime,” he told
himself, “and do all of my traveling at night.
And how I’m going to get anything to eat is a
question.”</p>

<p>Having rested and at the same time listened in
vain for some sounds of pursuit, the young lieutenant
went on his way, coming out of the woods
along the line of the railroad. Looking back,
he made out the distant village where the train
had stopped, and then hurried forward in the direction
from which he had come. He reasoned
that the train had been carrying him deeper into
the enemy’s country, and what he wanted to do
was to get back to the vicinity of the war front.</p>

<p>Our hero had traveled a distance of a mile or
more when he heard a rumble behind him. Looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
back, he saw a train approaching rather
slowly. As it came closer he made out that it
was a heavily loaded freight. It was going uphill,
and the engineer had all he could do to coax
the locomotive into hauling the load.</p>

<p>Our hero stood to one side and allowed a number
of cars to pass him. Then, struck by a sudden
thought, he watched his opportunity and
boarded the freight-train.</p>

<p>Dave had supposed that the entire train was
made up of cars filled with freight. But in this
the young lieutenant was mistaken. Several of
the cars in the center of the train contained soldiers
on their way to the front. More than this,
the train carried its regular guards, and as Dave
stood between two of the cars wondering what
he had best do next, he heard two of these guards
talking in guttural tones.</p>

<p>“They say four or five of the prisoners got
away,” he heard one of the men say, in German.</p>

<p>“That’s too bad, Heinrich. Do you suppose
they came this way?” remarked a second guard.</p>

<p>“Dolbear thought so,” went on the first
speaker. “He told me to tell you and the others
to be on the watch. If we see any of those rascals
we are to shoot them on sight.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>THE ENCOUNTER ON THE RIVER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">This</span> looks as if I had jumped from the frying-pan
into the fire.”</p>

<p>Such was Dave’s thought as he listened to what
was said by the German guards. He could not
understand every word spoken, but he gathered
enough to know that they were keeping a lookout
for him and some others who had leaped from
the prisoners’ train.</p>

<p>The two guards were on the top of one of the
cars, and only a few feet from where the young
lieutenant was in hiding. He crouched low on
one of the bumpers, running a serious risk of
being pinched should the cars make a sudden
swerve to one side or the other.</p>

<p>On and on puffed the train. The top of the
hill was presently gained, and then the cars increased
their speed and rattled forward over the
uneven rails and across numerous switches.</p>

<p>One of the guards had evidently gone toward
the rear of the train, and now the other started
to move forward. He leaped directly over our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
hero’s head from car to car, but he was too interested
in maintaining his footing to glance down,
so Dave remained undiscovered.</p>

<p>“I hope those fellows don’t come back this
way,” he muttered to himself, as he straightened
up, holding fast to one of the cars as he did so.
His cramped position had begun to tell on him,
and he was glad to make a change.</p>

<p>A couple of hours passed and the long freight
still continued on its way. It had rolled through
a number of villages and several small towns,
and had also crossed three small streams. Now
they were climbing another hill, and the speed
of the train was again slackened.</p>

<p>One of the towns through which they passed
Dave recognized as a place he had seen before,
and this gave him not a little satisfaction, for he
felt that he was once more headed for the fighting
front.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to get pretty close to it if I ever
expect to get back to our lines,” was the way he
reasoned. “It wouldn’t be any use for me to
attempt to travel any great distance through Germany,
especially wearing this uniform.”</p>

<p>As the train passed over the top of the second
long line of hills and began to increase its speed
down the other side, Dave resolved to make another
move. He knew that sooner or later the
freight would roll into some yard and there, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
the place was lighted up and well guarded, it
would be next to impossible to escape.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to leave this train before that happens,”
was the way he reasoned. “And I had
better take a look around and see what the prospects
ahead are.”</p>

<p>At the end of one of the freight cars was a
ladder-like arrangement, and with caution Dave
mounted this, to peer out over the top. He could
see nothing of the guards, and so sat down on the
top of the freight car to get a better view of his
surroundings. The sky was now clearing and a
number of stars were beginning to show themselves.</p>

<p>They were going down the grade rather rapidly,
and looking far ahead the young lieutenant
saw a gleam of brightness which he rightly took
to be a broad stream. On this side of the river
was a good-sized town.</p>

<p>In a few minutes more they rattled into the
outskirts of the town. It was quite dark, the
lights evidently being extinguished on account of
a possible air raid by the Americans or their
Allies. But in a tall tower was located a searchlight,
and this was suddenly turned on the train,
flashing along the tops of the cars from end to end.</p>

<p>Evidently the guards had been expecting this
light to fall upon them, for they were on the
alert and their eyes, following the bright beams,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
fell full upon Dave before he had any chance
to hide himself.</p>

<p>“Who are you? Throw up your hands!”
came the cry in German. And then, as Dave
started to drop down between the cars once more,
a shot rang out, followed by another.</p>

<p>Both of the bullets whistled close over our
hero’s head, and he made such a quick move out
of range that he almost lost his footing. As it
was, he dropped down on the bumper and had all
he could do to keep himself from going clear
through to the rails below. Had he done this,
he would have been instantly ground beneath the
wheels of the cars.</p>

<p>The train was now rattling through the town,
and a few seconds later it reached the near end
of the long bridge across the river.</p>

<p>“I guess here is where I’ll have to jump for
it,” thought the young lieutenant. He knew that
the guards above would be rushing to the spot
where they had last seen him and that they would
not hesitate to open fire again. He had no desire
to fall a victim to a German bullet.</p>

<p>The train ran out on the trestle; and the edge
of the cars was less than two feet from the outside
of the bridge. Bracing himself as best he
could, Dave took a long breath and then made the
leap.</p>

<p>“There he goes!” cried one of the guards.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_p252a">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p252a.jpg" alt="Dave took a long breath and then made the leap">

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“Shoot him!” exclaimed the other; and then
both blazed away with their rifles.</p>

<p>Dave felt a queer stinging sensation along the
outside of his left leg, and then he hit the waters
of the river with a loud splash and went under.
He knew he had been struck, and he hoped it
was not a serious wound.</p>

<p>Not to give the guards on the train a chance
to shoot at him again, our hero kept under water
as long as he could hold his breath. In the meantime,
the long freight-train continued over the
bridge and presently was lost to sight in the distance.</p>

<p>But the young lieutenant was too bewildered by
what had occurred to note the disappearance of
the train, and, coming up to the surface, he took
a hasty breath and then dived again.</p>

<p>When he came up a second time he dashed the
water from his eyes and endeavored to look
around him. All was semi-dark on the river and
everything was quiet.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m out of that, anyway, unless they
send word back to start a search for me,” he told
himself. “But what am I to do next?”</p>

<p>Fortunately for our hero, he had on only his
light summer outfit, so his clothing did not weigh
heavily upon him. The water was cool, but not
cold, and this was rather refreshing than otherwise
after his many days of confinement during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
which it had been impossible to get anything like
a bath.</p>

<p>The river was rather swiftly flowing, and the
young lieutenant allowed himself to be carried
along by the current, meanwhile, however, striking
out in the direction of the other shore. This
he knew would be bringing him just so much closer
to the firing-line. As he swam along he used his
left leg, and thereby ascertained that the wound
he had sustained was little more than a scratch,
for which he was thankful.</p>

<p>Dave had passed down the river a distance of
several hundred yards, and was within fifty rods
of the opposite shore, when an object coming
down the stream caught his attention. It was a
large rowboat manned by two soldiers who were
singing some sort of an army song in noisy, guttural
tones.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to take care that those fellows don’t
discover me,” the young lieutenant reasoned, and
then struck out toward the distant shore in an
endeavor to evade the on-coming craft.</p>

<p>Had the two soldiers in the boat been perfectly
sober they would probably have kept on a straight
course and passed Dave. But, as it chanced, both
of them had been drinking heavily and were consequently
somewhat befuddled. They managed
their oars in anything but a skillful manner, and
as a consequence when the boat was close to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
our hero it suddenly swerved around, hitting Dave
in the shoulder.</p>

<p>The blow was not a hard one, but it was sufficient
to send the young lieutenant under and to
knock a good deal of the wind out of him. When
he came up he was at the stern of the rowboat,
and this he clutched with both hands.</p>

<p>“Ha! who is there, Hans?” bawled one of the
German soldiers.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Let us find out,” answered
Hans, and, dropping his oar, he stumbled to the
stern of the boat and caught Dave by both wrists.
Then the other German soldier also leaped back,
and between them they hauled Dave up and into
the craft.</p>

<p>“Upon my head, I think it is one of those
Yankee swine!” cried one of the soldiers in astonishment,
as he peered into Dave’s face and
looked at his water-soaked uniform.</p>

<p>“What? An American!” roared the other.
“Dump him into the river again; he deserves
nothing better than to be drowned.”</p>

<p>“No, no! Now we have him, let us take him
to camp as our prisoner,” was the mumbled reply.
“We shall get a good deal of credit for capturing
one of those beasts.”</p>

<p>To this the young lieutenant answered nothing,
for the reason that he was almost out of breath,
and, furthermore, the befuddled soldiers spoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
in a German dialect of which he hardly understood
a word.</p>

<p>“Hands up, you son of a rat!” muttered one
of the soldiers, as our hero sank down on one
of the middle seats of the large rowboat. “Don’t
try to play any tricks on us.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he made a clumsy pass at the
young lieutenant, and it was then for the first
time that Dave realized the truth of the situation,
which was that the two soldiers were in no fit
condition to manage the rowboat. They had evidently
been sent from their camp into town on
an errand, and while on this had taken the opportunity
to treat themselves liberally to liquor.</p>

<p>Dave realized that if he wanted to escape from
the clutches of the enemy, he must do some quick
thinking, if not acting. Seeing the condition of
the two soldiers, he let out a groan as if in deep
pain and sank down on the bottom of the rowboat.</p>

<p>“He must be wounded, or else he has been
swimming a long distance,” mumbled one of the
soldiers.</p>

<p>“Well, that will make it so much the easier
to take him along. Let the pig lie where he is
until we reach the landing. Then we’ll make
him march along, or else shoot him.”</p>

<p>Both soldiers picked up their oars once more
and endeavored to continue their rowing. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
had his feet in the middle of Dave’s back and
took savage delight in punching his heels into the
prisoner.</p>

<p>“I’d like to have all the Americans under me
just like this one,” he mumbled to his companion.</p>

<p>“We’ll have them all under our feet some day,”
answered the other. “They will be sorry they ever
went to war against the <i>Vaterland</i>;” and then the
soldier began his singing again, in which his companion
presently joined.</p>

<p>Dave noted with satisfaction that the guns of
both of the soldiers lay forward, on the bottom
of the rowboat. While the craft was passing
along in the darkness he put forth one hand cautiously
and pulled first one gun and then the other
toward him. He did not dare to raise either of
the weapons; but he placed them in such a position
that neither of the Germans could get at
them very readily.</p>

<p>A full mile had been covered on the journey
down the river, and one soldier was looking ahead
as if to see at what point he might make a landing,
when Dave resolved to act. He felt somewhat
recovered, and, gathering himself for the
effort, he suddenly leaped up and caught one of
the soldiers by the arm.</p>

<p>“Stop! What does this mean?” spluttered
the fellow, but before he could utter another
word Dave had him half overboard. Then he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
gave the soldier a shove which sent him headlong
into the water.</p>

<p>The encounter had been a brief one, but short
as it was it had given the second soldier a chance
to leap up and at the young lieutenant. He came
at our hero very much like a big bear, fastening
himself on Dave’s back with a grab at his throat
which was as painful as it was dangerous.</p>

<p>But all the young lieutenant’s fighting blood
was now aroused, and, standing straight up, he
suddenly bent low, sending the German soldier
flying into the air and over his head.</p>

<p>The fellow gave a yell of rage and alarm, but
he did not lose his grip; and a moment later both
he and Dave splashed overboard into the swiftly
flowing river!</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br>

<small>DEEP IN THE WOODS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Evidently</span> the German soldier who had gone
overboard with Dave knew little or nothing about
swimming, for the minute he touched the water
he seemed to grow frantic, clutching our hero
around the neck in a deathlike grip.</p>

<p>“Save me! Save me! Don’t let me drown!”
he spluttered hoarsely, in German, as soon as
both of them came to the surface again.</p>

<p>The young lieutenant did not reply to this. He
was in the grip of a deadly enemy, and he did
not purpose to lose his life if he could help it.
Gathering what strength remained to him, he
twisted around and gave the German a stinging
blow in the chin.</p>

<p>Ordinarily such a blow would have caused the
other to fall back; but now fear clutched at the
German’s heart, and though his head went back
with a jerk, he still retained his hold upon our
hero. Evidently he did not intend to drown unless
Dave did likewise.</p>

<p>By this time the rowboat had drifted down the
stream away from the pair. But one of the oars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
was close at hand and Dave seized hold of this.
From a distance came a yell for help, evidently
from the first soldier who had gone overboard.
These cries gradually became fainter and fainter,
and then ceased altogether.</p>

<p>With the oar in his hand, the young lieutenant
wondered what he had best do next. He must
act quickly, for already both he and the German
soldier were on the point of going down a second
time.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a cruel thing to do, but this was
war, and Dave did not purpose to lose his life
if he could possibly avoid it. He brought the
broad point of the oar around, and, catching the
blade with both hands, made a jab with all of his
strength for the German’s throat.</p>

<p>The thrust went true, the sharp end of the oar
catching the man full in the neck. The force of
the blow made him gasp, and for the instant his
hold upon Dave was relaxed. Our hero made
another lunge with the oar, catching the fellow
in the breast and sending him several yards away.
Then the German suddenly disappeared from view
beneath the surface of the river; and that was the
last the young lieutenant saw of him.</p>

<p>Dave swam a distance of twenty odd feet, and
then looked back to see if he was being pursued.
But when neither of the German soldiers showed
himself, he continued his swimming, heading for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
the distant shore and also for the rowboat which
was drifting on ahead of him. It did not take
him long to reach the boat, and, almost exhausted,
he pulled himself aboard and sank down on the
middle seat.</p>

<p>Less than ten minutes had elapsed since Dave
had made his attack on the enemy, yet to him it
seemed as if it was an age. He had been close
to death, and he thanked Providence for his escape.</p>

<p>“More than likely both of those chaps are
drowned,” he told himself. “Even if they could
swim, they were both too befuddled by liquor to
take care of themselves.”</p>

<p>The rowboat was without oars, so he had to
let the craft take its own course to a large degree.
He did find a small board in the bottom of the
boat, and with this as a paddle succeeded in heading
more toward the shore than before.</p>

<p>The craft had passed a point where there were
a number of small lights as if belonging to some
village or camp, and was now drifting along a
portion of the stream where all was dark.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to make a landing sooner or later,”
he reasoned; “and I might as well turn in here
as anywhere. If I see anything to alarm me, I
can slip overboard and swim for it.”</p>

<p>In utter silence he turned the boat toward the
shore, and presently the current brought it close
alongside a number of bushes which overhung the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
river bank. Dave caught hold of these bushes,
and then by peering around in the semi-darkness
at last made out a little opening in the bank. Into
this, by means of the heavy brushwood growing
on all sides, he pulled the boat until it was almost
entirely hidden from view.</p>

<p>By this time the sky had cleared more than
ever, and all the stars were shining brightly.
Growing accustomed to the semi-darkness beneath
the bushes, Dave, after resting for a minute, arose
cautiously and, standing on the middle seat of the
rowboat, peered around him.</p>

<p>All that he could see was the river with the
bank fringed with brushwood backed up by a
small forest. In the distance he thought he could
discern the outlines of a number of stone buildings,
but of this he was not certain. Looking out
on the stream, he could see nothing in the shape
of a boat.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look to me as if there were any
guards around here,” he told himself. “But
those soldiers must have been bound for some
camp, so I’ll have to be very careful about showing
myself or making any noise.”</p>

<p>Having completed the survey, Dave sat down
on the seat of the boat and gave himself up to
his meditations. He also wrung some of the
water from his clothing and took off his shoes
to empty them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>In the bottom of the boat still lay the two rifles,
and both were loaded, as he noted with satisfaction.
He resolved, if it became necessary to do
so, to use the rifles and sell his life as dearly as
possible.</p>

<p>A long-drawn hour went by, and during that
time Dave made himself as comfortable as possible
in the rowboat. This, of course, was not
saying much, for the boat was bare of anything
in the way of blankets or cushions. He tried
to sleep, but succeeded only in getting a few fitful
naps, awakening from each with a violent
start.</p>

<p>“I guess this situation is getting on my nerves,
all right enough,” he murmured. “My, what
wouldn’t I give to be back safe and sound with
our boys!” And then he pictured himself safe
in the quarters at the abandoned mines. He wondered
what his chums had thought concerning his
disappearance.</p>

<p>Slowly the night wore away, and at the first
streak of dawn Dave arose on the seat of the rowboat
and took another look around.</p>

<p>He had been right about the stone buildings in
the distance. They were located half-way up the
wooded side of a hill and were evidently some
ancient castle.</p>

<p>Up and down the stream he noted several villages
and towns, but they were all a goodly distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
away. Near him seemed to be nothing but
the brushwood and trees with some farm lands
behind them.</p>

<p>As soon as it became light enough to do so,
Dave set to work to push the rowboat still further
in among the bushes until it was completely hidden.
Then he began a closer inspection of the
craft, having noticed that it contained two small
lockers, one at the bow and the other under the
stern seat. In the bow locker was a small amount
of fishing tackle, and this he examined with care.</p>

<p>“If I can’t find anything else to eat, maybe I
can catch a few fish,” he thought. “Although
how I am going to cook them without being noticed,
I don’t know.”</p>

<p>From the bow locker our hero turned to that
under the stern seat, and here a pleasant surprise
awaited him. The locker contained a bundle
rolled up in a raincoat, such as he had seen the
German soldiers occasionally wearing.</p>

<p>“That raincoat will help me disguise myself,”
he reasoned with satisfaction. “And there, too,
is a hat to go with it. Good enough!”</p>

<p>The bundle was done up in an old newspaper
tied with a cord; and, undoing this, our hero
brought forth several links of smoked bologna, a
loaf of fresh bread, and a covered dish filled
with potato salad.</p>

<p>It may be surmised that Dave lost no time in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
supplying himself with an early morning meal,
washing it down with a drink from the river. The
bologna, although rather highly seasoned, proved
to be quite palatable, and the bread was much
better than he had seen since becoming a prisoner.
The potato salad, too, was very good, even though
smelling quite strongly of onions.</p>

<p>“Not exactly like the Waldorf-Astoria in New
York or the Parker House in Boston, but it’s
plenty good enough for a hungry fellow like me,
and I’m mighty thankful that I’ve found such
food,” was what he told himself, as he proceeded
to make himself at home.</p>

<p>With nothing to do, Dave took his time over
the meal, and after he had finished he put away
what was left of the food with great care.</p>

<p>“It may have to last me for several days,” he
thought.</p>

<p>By the time the young lieutenant had finished
the repast the sun had come up full and clear and
it was growing much warmer. This being so, he
disrobed and hung his clothing on the nearby
bushes to dry, in the meantime covering himself
with the raincoat.</p>

<p>By the middle of the afternoon Dave had become
pretty well rested and his clothing was thoroughly
dry. Dressing himself once more, he put
on the raincoat and the hat he had found and took
up one of the rifles and also the package of food.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
As he did not wish to burden himself with the
second firearm, he unloaded this, placing the extra
shells in his pocket.</p>

<p>“Now I’m pretty well fixed,” he thought.
“I’ve got on a German raincoat and hat and I’ve
got a loaded rifle with some extra ammunition, and
also some food. If I can’t manage to get along
on that I’m no good.”</p>

<p>But though the young lieutenant told himself
these things, he realized that he was in a precarious
position. He was in the enemy’s country,
and should they discover him they would most
likely shoot him down on sight.</p>

<p>“Having been captured once, I’ll be worse off
than ever,” he mused. “I’ve certainly got to
watch things closely.”</p>

<p>He had already made up his mind in what direction
he intended to travel. That was away from
the river and up to the top of the hill which lay to
the westward.</p>

<p>“The fighting front must be in that direction,”
he told himself. “But I guess it is a long way
off, otherwise I’d hear the booming of the artillery.”</p>

<p>With the bundle tied by a fishline over his
shoulder, and with his gun ready for use, the
young lieutenant left the vicinity of the rowboat
and toiled slowly and painfully along through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
brushwood and then among the trees leading to
the top of the hill. He had thus progressed about
a hundred yards when he came out on a footpath
which presently led into an old wood road, evidently
used by the foresters of that vicinity.</p>

<p>An hour of hard trudging brought Dave at last
to the top of the hill. As he advanced he heard
a low rumble in the distance which gradually increased
in intensity.</p>

<p>“It’s the artillery, all right enough!” he told
himself with satisfaction. “I can’t be so very
far from the fighting front after all. I must have
come farther on that freight-train than I imagined.”</p>

<p>Getting to the very top of the hill, Dave took a
careful look around, and, having assured himself
that no one was in that vicinity, he dropped his
bundle, his rifle, and the raincoat, and commenced
to climb one of the tall trees growing close by.</p>

<p>Even when a boy on the farm Dave had been a
good climber, and he went up branch after branch
until he found himself at the very top of the tree.</p>

<p>Here a grand panorama, stretching for many
miles, was spread out all around him. He could
see the river he had left gleaming brightly in the
sunshine, and the smoke from a number of villages
and towns along its banks. But most of his attention
was fastened on the landscape to the west.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
Here the rumble of the cannons had increased, and
he could occasionally see a vast cloud of smoke
arising and rolling southward.</p>

<p>“That’s the fighting front, all right enough,”
he told himself. “Now the thing of it is to get
there and then to get through to our side. I wonder
if I can do it?”</p>

<p>Our hero was about to descend from the tree
and continue his journey when a noise below
reached his ears.</p>

<p>“I am quite sure he came this way,” said a
voice, in German.</p>

<p>“Then he can’t be very far off,” was the reply.</p>

<p>With caution the young lieutenant peered down
toward the ground and presently made out the
figures of two German soldiers.</p>

<p>“They must be after somebody, and most likely
they’re after me,” he reasoned. “If they spot
me, what am I to do?”</p>

<p>Dave kept quiet for several minutes, and then
heard voices in the distance. Presently three
other German soldiers appeared, and then the
whole five came to a halt directly under the tree
in which he was hiding.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br>

<small>WHAT DAVE’S CHUMS DID</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Phil</span>, it doesn’t look as if we were ever going
to hear of Dave again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Roger, don’t say anything like that!”
burst out Phil Lawrence. “Why, it gives me a
cold shiver just to think of it.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you suppose it makes me feel
blue?” said the senator’s son, seriously. “Why,
last night I hardly slept a wink just thinking about
Dave’s disappearance.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help but reach the conclusion that he
was captured by the Germans,” put in Ben, who
sat near. “If it had been otherwise we would
have discovered his body.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure about that,” answered the
senator’s son. “He may have wandered off further
than we suppose. And you must remember
the underbrush is very thick in spots and conceals
many openings among the rocks. He may have
taken a long walk, and then have tried to get back
by a short cut and lost his way. If that happened,
it would be an easy thing for him to take some
dangerous tumble in the dark.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>“And then remember, there are always those
holes leading into the abandoned mines,” came
from Buster. “He may have rolled into one of
those and been unable to find his way out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say, speaking of the holes leading into
the mines puts me in mind of a story,” began
Shadow. “Once there were three boys—” He
stopped abruptly and looked contritely into the
sober faces of his chums. “Confound it, anyway!
what business have I got to try to tell a story at
such a time as this? Excuse me, fellows. I—I
feel just as bad over this as any of you do,” he
added, lamely.</p>

<p>“Speaking about holes,” resumed Roger, after
an awkward silence, “Phil and I examined two
more of them yesterday, but got no trace whatever
of Dave. That makes about the tenth time we
have been out on a search.”</p>

<p>“And I have been out just as many times,”
came from Ben; and Buster and Shadow nodded to
infer that they had done practically the same thing.</p>

<p>Several days had passed since our hero’s disappearance,
and the time had dragged heavily with
his chums. Had it not been for the daily tasks
assigned to them, they would have been a most
miserable crowd. Even as it was, whenever they
were off duty they invariably went on a hunt for
their missing friend.</p>

<p>“Have you written anything to his folks yet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
Roger, as you spoke of doing?” questioned Phil,
a little later, when Shadow and Buster had left
the others.</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t, Phil,” was the slow reply. “I
can’t pluck up the courage to do it. What Dave’s
folks and the Wadsworths will say when the news
reaches them is something I hate to think of.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you in that,” answered the shipowner’s
son. “I’m sure such bad news will put
Jessie Wadsworth to bed.”</p>

<p>“And Laura, Phil. Don’t forget her. She
thinks the world and all of her brother.”</p>

<p>“It’s too blamed bad, that’s what it is!” burst
out Ben. “Oh, I do wish we could learn what
has become of him!”</p>

<p>The young engineers had been kept fairly busy,
for the American army and their allies were advancing
steadily. The Americans had had one or
two hot contests for the possession of several
French villages. They had driven the Germans
from the outskirts, and then from the villages
themselves, and finally into the woods beyond,
making an advance of ten or fifteen miles all along
the front. The casualties had been heavy, and
as a consequence the field hospitals were crowded
with the wounded.</p>

<p>In these battles the engineers had had small
part, but now they were sent once more to the
front, to repair the roads and also make safe two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
of the villages, work which was as interesting as it
was hazardous.</p>

<p>On the following afternoon Roger, Phil, and a
number of the others found themselves in a small
French village where they had been sent to clean
up some of the wreckage in the main street, so that
the army could use the thoroughfare for the passage
of the artillery. A battalion of infantry was
located at this village, and this included the company
to which Nat Poole and Lieutenant Gebauer
belonged.</p>

<p>“Hello! there is Nat Poole!” remarked Phil
presently, when the young soldier in question came
out of one of the half-wrecked buildings in that
vicinity.</p>

<p>“Let us ask him if he has seen or heard anything
of Dave,” returned Roger.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it will do a bit of good,” remarked
Ben, who was with the others.</p>

<p>As soon as he saw his former schoolmates approaching,
the money lender’s son attempted to
evade them by passing around the corner of another
ruined building. But all quickened their
pace and soon caught up with him.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Nat!” called Roger. “We
want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>The young soldier turned a startled and haggard
face toward them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>“I don’t want to talk to you fellows,” he
grumbled. “I want to be left alone.”</p>

<p>“See here, Nat, what’s got into you?” questioned
Ben, coming closer. “You look scared to
death.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t so!” cried the other quickly. “I’m
not a bit scared! And I don’t want you to talk
to me that way, Ben Basswood!”</p>

<p>“We were only going to ask you about Dave,”
went on Roger. “He is still missing, and I
wanted to know if you had heard anything at all
of him.”</p>

<p>“Not a thing.” Nat’s face began to show
greater alarm. “I want you fellows to leave me
alone! You act just as if you thought I had something
to do with Dave Porter’s disappearance.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you did have something to do with
it!” cried Phil, struck by a sudden idea.</p>

<p>“Has Lieutenant Gebauer seen him?” questioned
Roger.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but—er—I don’t think so,”
added Nat falteringly. “Why don’t you ask him
and find out for yourself?”</p>

<p>“I will,” said the senator’s son. “Where is
he?”</p>

<p>“Humph! don’t ask me.”</p>

<p>Something in Nat’s manner caused his former
schoolmates further surprise. Evidently he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
something on his mind which he did not wish to
have leak out.</p>

<p>“Isn’t Lieutenant Gebauer here?” questioned
Ben.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Was he shot or captured?”
queried Phil.</p>

<p>“No, he wasn’t shot or captured,” grumbled
the money lender’s son. “He has lost his commission
and been sent to the rear, if you must
know!” he flared out.</p>

<p>“You don’t say!” burst out Roger and Phil
simultaneously. Here was news indeed.</p>

<p>“What caused it, Nat? He must have done
something awful to have such a thing happen to
him,” remarked Ben.</p>

<p>“They said it was for cowardice in the face
of the enemy. I don’t know anything about it,
because I wasn’t with our company at the time. I
ate something that didn’t agree with me and was
on the sick list.”</p>

<p>“Who made the charge against Gebauer?”
asked Roger, quickly.</p>

<p>“The major of our battalion. He was as mad
as a hornet. Some one said he threatened to
shoot the lieutenant. It seems Gebauer gave
some sort of an order for the men to retreat when
everybody wanted to advance. I guess he was terribly
scared. Anyway, he started to run, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
threw all the men into confusion until the top sergeant
came along and rallied our boys and sent
them ahead again. It was a fierce mix-up, and
Gebauer got it not only from the major, but also
from the captain and some of the other officers
of the regiment. Then they took him to headquarters,
and the next thing I knew he had been
sent to the rear.”</p>

<p>“Well, that sure is a come-down for Gebauer,”
murmured Phil. “Gee! I wouldn’t have that
happen to me for the world.”</p>

<p>“He’ll be disgraced for the rest of his life,”
added Ben.</p>

<p>“I guess the best thing you can do, Nat, is to
steer clear of such cattle,” said the senator’s son.
“No one will ever want to forgive a fellow who
was a coward in the face of the enemy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m done with Gebauer; so you don’t have
to preach to me about that,” growled the money
lender’s son sourly. “I found out what he was
quite some time ago.” And then, after a few
more words, Nat Poole marched away from the
others, looking anything but happy.</p>

<p>“He acts as if he had something on his mind,”
was the way Ben expressed himself.</p>

<p>“Probably he is very much upset over the way
Gebauer acted,” returned Phil. “The pair were
quite chummy, if you’ll remember.”</p>

<p>“There was something about that Gebauer I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
never liked,” said Roger slowly. “He always
made me think of a snake in the grass. I’ve got
half a notion that he was a pro-German. Maybe
his cowardice was all put on. He may have just
been acting that way trying to help the enemy to
a victory.”</p>

<p>“Gosh! If that’s so, he ought to be exposed!”
cried Ben.</p>

<p>“Probably he has been exposed. They
wouldn’t send him to the rear for nothing.”</p>

<p>The next day the battle was on again in all its
fury. The Americans advanced through one of
the villages, and then up a long hillside leading
to some new positions which the Germans had
fortified. There was much for both the infantry
and the artillery to do, and the bombardment by
the small and big guns kept up night and day, until
the ground fairly trembled with the concussions.</p>

<p>There was much for the engineers to do, and
Roger and his chums worked for sixteen hours,
scarcely stopping to eat. They had a road to cut
through one of the forests, and had also to build
several small bridges.</p>

<p>It was highly dangerous work, and more than
once a bomb exploded close to them, sending the
dirt and rocks flying in every direction. Once
Shadow went down, struck in the head, and some
of the others had to carry him to the rear. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
was not dangerously wounded, however, for which
he was thankful.</p>

<p>In the midst of the work by the engineers, some
of the infantry advanced once more. This embraced
the company to which Nat Poole belonged,
and a little later came another bombardment by
the Germans which sent the trees and brushwood
flying in all directions, so that that section of the
forest became little less than an inferno.</p>

<p>“Gee, but this is getting hot!” ejaculated Phil,
after a bomb had exploded close in front of them,
sending sticks of wood, rocks, and a shower of dirt
flying in all directions.</p>

<p>The engineers were ordered to move to the
right, making their way as best they could through
a tangle of brushwood. Roger and Phil were
side by side when they heard a sudden yell for
help.</p>

<p>“That sounds like Nat Poole’s voice!” exclaimed
Roger, and started on a run for the spot
whence the cry proceeded.</p>

<p>Phil followed his chum, and Ben came close behind
the pair. Soon all three reached a point
where a shell had cut off two trees about five feet
up from the ground. The trunks of the trees had
come down with a tremendous crash one on top of
the other, and both were lying in a tangle of brushwood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>“Help, help!” was the cry, and now the chums
felt certain it came from the money lender’s son.</p>

<p>Soon they reached the vicinity of the fallen trees.
Here the jumble of tree limbs and brushwood was
so thick they could scarcely see into it. From the
midst continued to come the cry for help.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Nat?” called out Roger.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! Save me! Save me!” screamed
the money lender’s son. “These trees are choking
the life out of me!”</p>

<p>Fortunately, Roger and Ben were armed with
axes, while Phil carried a crowbar. Worming
their way in among the tangle of brushwood and
branches, they presently came to the place where
Nat lay. He was flat on his back with the weight
of one of the trees resting heavily upon his
stomach.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to chop him loose,” said Phil,
after a hasty survey of the situation. They saw
that it would be practically impossible for them to
raise up that mass of fallen timber.</p>

<p>With the roar of battle raging all around them,
the young engineers set to work with the axes, and
in less than ten minutes had chopped away two of
the tree limbs. Then another was pried to one
side by Ben and Phil, and while this was done
Roger dragged the money lender’s son to a safe
position.</p>

<p>Nat was so weak he could scarcely stand, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
Roger and Ben supported him as they led the way
out of the tangle. Then they fell in with several
soldiers belonging to Nat’s company.</p>

<p>“You had better take charge of this fellow,”
said Roger to one of the men. “I don’t know
how badly he has been hurt. A couple of trees
came down on top of him.”</p>

<p>“My stomach is smashed!” groaned Nat dolefully.
“I know I’ll never be able to walk straight
again! I am done for!” And then, as a sudden
twinge of pain seized him, he went on with a sob:
“I knew it! I knew I would have to suffer! I
had no right to do what I did! Oh, what shall I
do? What shall I do?” And then, suddenly
throwing up both hands, Nat Poole fell in a dead
faint.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br>

<small>THE GERMAN HEADQUARTERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Scarcely</span> daring to breathe, Dave kept himself
near the top of the tree, doing what he could
to hide from the observation of the five German
soldiers below. He knew that they most likely
had discovered the raincoat, the package of food,
and the rifle he had left at the foot of the tree;
and that being so, they would take it for granted
that he could not be far away.</p>

<p>He heard the five soldiers talking earnestly, and
also heard them tear open the package of food
he had been carrying.</p>

<p>“Ha! he lives pretty high,” was the comment
of one of the soldiers. “Smoked bologna and
potato salad! Very good! I think, comrades,
we can dispose of this in short order.”</p>

<p>“We certainly can,” returned another soldier,
and the whole five, who were evidently hungry,
lost no time in disposing of what remained of the
food.</p>

<p>Making no noise, Dave succeeded in lowering
himself to one of the larger limbs of the tree.
Then, as the soldiers continued to talk and eat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
having thrown themselves on the ground for that
purpose, he worked his way out on the limb until
he was almost to the end.</p>

<p>Below him he could make out a mass of brushwood
and also several rocks. These partly
screened the spot where he might land from the
trunk of the tree. But the distance to the ground
was all of fifteen feet, and our hero was by no
means sure that he could make the drop in safety.
If he sprained an ankle or injured his foot, it
would be all up with him.</p>

<p>“But I’ve got to take some chances,” he murmured
to himself. “I don’t intend to go back to
one of their prison pens. Besides, having escaped
once, it may be that they would shoot me on sight.”</p>

<p>He gave himself a moment more of thought,
and then, gritting his teeth, suddenly swung out
to the end of the limb and let his body drop.</p>

<p>As he came swiftly down he heard a yell of surprise
from one of the soldiers. Then all leaped
up, grabbing their weapons as they did so.</p>

<p>Fortunately for our hero, he came down in
some of the brushwood, and this broke his fall to
such an extent that he was not injured save for a
few scratches. Having landed, he leaped out of
the bushes and then sped through the woods at the
best rate of speed he could command.</p>

<p>Crack! Crack! went one rifle after another, and
the bullets whistled uncomfortably close to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>However, he was not struck, and soon the
brushwood and the trees screened him so completely
that further shooting was out of the question.</p>

<p>But Dave knew the German soldiers must be
after him, and he kept on running until he was
well-nigh exhausted. He was going downhill at
the time, and he had to be careful that he did not
pitch headlong over some of the rough rocks which
cropped out here and there on the hillside.</p>

<p>At the foot of the hill ran a small brook, and
here he paused long enough to get a drink. Then
he walked along through the brook for quite a
distance, doing this that he might hide any trail
that he had left behind. He had heard that the
enemy occasionally used hounds in getting on the
track of escaped prisoners.</p>

<p>Beyond the hill and the brook was a wide valley
dotted with numerous farms. Here the country
was more or less open, and he wondered how he
could make another advance. He moved along
the brook, and presently came to an old stone
bridge, over which ran a fairly good highway.</p>

<p>One side of the bridge was hidden in a mass of
bushes, and here the young lieutenant found a
fairly good hiding-place. From this he did not
dare to venture until darkness had fallen, in the
meantime keeping his eyes and ears wide open for
the possible appearance of the soldiers who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
discovered him. But they did not come that way,
and he at last concluded that he must have thrown
them off the trail.</p>

<p>It was probably nine o’clock in the evening when
Dave resolved to resume his journey westward.
He crawled out on the roadway just as a farmer
came along driving a box-wagon loaded with
barrels.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I dare chance a ride?” he said
to himself; and then, as the back of the wagon
passed him, he made a quick leap, landing between
several barrels. He wormed his way in between
the barrels, finally coming to a sitting position well
hidden from the farmer, who sat on the front seat
driving.</p>

<p>Two hours passed, and in that time the wagon
covered a distance of at least twelve miles. The
valley with its farms was left behind, and they
were beginning to ascend a slight rise of ground.
Here there was another patch of woods.</p>

<p>During the ride Dave discovered that one of
the barrels in the wagon contained apples and another
pears, and he appropriated as much of this
fruit as he wished to eat.</p>

<p>“Get up there, you!” cried the farmer in German
to his team. “We’ll soon be there now, and
I’ll be glad of it. This has been a long drive.”</p>

<p>Dave could see that they were approaching
some sort of an estate, and from the words of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
farmer concluded that a stop was to be made there.
Consequently, he thought it about time for him to
leave the wagon, and lost no time in doing so.</p>

<p>This move was a fortunate one for our hero,
because less than two minutes later the wagon
turned in at a massive stone gateway where several
men were on guard. Seeing the lights flashing in
the darkness and the figures of some men moving
along, Dave lost no time in dropping out of sight
into the woods on the opposite side of the road.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m about twelve miles nearer the fighting
front, anyway,” he reasoned. “I suppose
from now on I’ve got to be doubly careful as to
how I advance.”</p>

<p>With the coming of nightfall the rumble of
battle had died away. But from the sounds of
the last shots fired, he had reached the conclusion
that the fighting front could not be any great distance
off.</p>

<p>As the young lieutenant hid in the woods opposite
the gateway he heard a sound on the road
from the westward, and presently several German
officers on horseback came riding along.
They were talking earnestly, and turned into the
same gate which the farmer had used.</p>

<p>“Hello! maybe that’s some sort of headquarters,”
Dave murmured to himself. “If it is,
I had better watch out for myself. They must
have guards all around here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>It would have been the part of prudence for our
hero to have placed as much distance as possible
between himself and such a place. But the young
lieutenant had not only the bravery of the average
American soldier, but he had likewise his share
of curiosity, and now that he was so close to these
German officers he wondered how they were carrying
on the conduct of the war.</p>

<p>“I’d like to spy on them a little and see just
how they do it,” he told himself. “Gracious!
what a story it will be to tell if ever I get back!”</p>

<p>His curiosity finally got the better of him, and,
watching his opportunity, he slipped across the
road again and then climbed the stone fence of
the estate. He knew he was taking a tremendous
chance, for there might not only be soldiers in that
vicinity, but the owner of the place might have a
number of watch-dogs.</p>

<p>Looking ahead through the trees and brushwood,
the young lieutenant presently made out a
large stone-pile, evidently an ancient German
castle. All was dark from the outside save the
light which peered from around the cracks of dark
curtains pulled down over the windows. But as
the night was warm, most of the windows were
open and the air blowing would occasionally shift
a curtain so that a look inside could be obtained.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no soldiers on that side of
the building, so our hero had little difficulty in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
making his way forward until he was within a
short distance of the castle. He could hear loud
and earnest talking coming from probably six or
eight officers. They were gathered in a room not
far from where he was standing, and when the
wind raised the curtain of one of the windows for
a few seconds, Dave saw that they were seated
around a large table containing a number of maps
and documents.</p>

<p>“And you think the Crown Prince will be here
to-night?” questioned one of the officers presently.</p>

<p>“That’s what he said, Captain Baska,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“I doubt if he will agree to this plan,” came
from another officer. “Probably he will have a
plan of his own,” he added, rather sourly.</p>

<p>The discussion continued, the officers in the
meantime consulting the maps and some of the
documents which lay before them. All were
smoking and to let in some fresh air, one of the
curtains of a window was raised several inches.</p>

<p>Presently there was a commotion at the front
of the castle, and a moment later an under officer
came into the room somewhat out of breath.</p>

<p>“The Crown Prince!” he announced.</p>

<p>Instantly all of the officers in the room arose
to their feet and left the apartment, evidently intending
to greet the German Crown Prince at the
entrance to the castle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>Peering under the curtain into the room, Dave
saw that the apartment was empty. The table
where the officers had sat was less than two feet
away, and on it still rested the maps and the documents
they had been consulting.</p>

<p>It was an opportunity too good to be lost.
Though he was running a tremendous risk, Dave
raised the curtain to the window a trifle higher,
threw his body over the window sill, and stretched
out his hands toward the table. With a quick
move he gathered in the maps and the documents,
rolled them into a bundle, and pulled them toward
him. Then he dropped from the window again,
pulled down the curtain, and ran with all possible
speed toward the rear of the castle.</p>

<p>“Now if they catch me they’ll kill me sure,” he
thought. “But they are not going to catch me if
I can possibly help it.”</p>

<p>He rolled the maps and the documents still
tighter, and thrust them into an inside pocket, buttoning
his coat tightly over them. Then he continued
on his way until he reached the stone fence,
over which he climbed with little difficulty.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the young lieutenant, the night
was clear, so that when his eyes became accustomed
to the semi-darkness he managed to progress
fairly well. He stumbled on and on until he
reached the roadway once more, and then headed
westward as before. He listened for an alarm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
from the castle, but strange to say it did not come.</p>

<p>“I guess they haven’t gone back to that room
yet,” he thought. “Well, I hope they don’t go
back until I’m a long distance away.”</p>

<p>He kept to the highway for about two miles
further, and then, reaching the outskirts of a small
village, turned slightly to the northward. Here
there was another patch of woods, and into this
he plunged, finally reaching a place where he
thought it would be safe to sit down and make
up his mind what to do next.</p>

<p>Dave had rested a quarter of an hour when
suddenly he heard a noise about a hundred yards
further within the wood. Then, of a sudden,
came a roar which almost deafened him. This
roar was followed by others, until the very ground
under him seemed to tremble.</p>

<p>He leaped to his feet, and with good reason.
With that opening roar came a discovery which
interested him tremendously. He had reached
the vicinity of the fighting front without knowing
it. Directly in front of him was one of the German
batteries, and it was now in full action.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br>

<small>THE LAST FIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">They</span> must be getting ready for an advance,
or else they are trying to hold back the advance of
our own men.” Such was the thought of the
young lieutenant as the German battery continued
to pound away with unusual vigor.</p>

<p>The bombing soon covered a distance of many
miles, showing that a move of some sort was either
taking place or was contemplated.</p>

<p>“Maybe if there is a real battle it will give me a
chance to get through the lines,” Dave reasoned,
and his heart gave a bound of hope. If he could
only get through quickly and reach headquarters,
perhaps the maps and documents he had confiscated
from the enemy might prove of great
value to the Americans.</p>

<p>Climbing a tree, our hero surveyed the situation
as well as the semi-darkness permitted. He
could see numerous flashes of fire from the great
German guns along a line which stretched out as
far as his eye could reach.</p>

<p>The young lieutenant knew he would be running
a tremendous risk to attempt to pass through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
that line, and yet he felt he must undertake to do
this if he was to escape at all. He descended
from the tree, and with great caution moved
slowly through the brushwood, making sure of
every step that was in front of him. Once or
twice he thought he was coming upon a German
guard, but these alarms proved false, and he continued
on his way with as great caution as before.</p>

<p>As he advanced he presently made out the forms
of a small body of men moving across a corner of
a field in the direction of a patch of timber much
mutilated by artillery fire. Even at that distance
and in such a dim light, he felt sure that the moving
men were Germans.</p>

<p>“It’s a night raid of some sort,” he reasoned.
“Maybe they are going over to see if they can’t
get hold of some Americans and make them prisoners.
Probably they want some information and
that is the only way they can get it.”</p>

<p>Hardly knowing why he was doing it, Dave followed
the Germans until he saw them disappear
among the trees of the wood. Then he came to a
hole, and just as some star shells flamed forth,
lighting up the scene, he dropped down into this.</p>

<p>For several seconds the light in the hole was
quite distinct, and during that time our hero made
a discovery that shocked him. A German lay in
the hole, holding his rifle in his hands as if ready
to use the weapon instantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>With a quick leap Dave sprang for this man,
taking him completely by surprise. The fellow
struggled to rise, but the young lieutenant held
him down, and at the same time made a quick
grab for the gun, tearing it from the German’s
grasp.</p>

<p>“<i>Kamerad! Kamerad!</i>” yelled the German,
when Dave turned the weapon around and pointed
it at his head. “<i>Kamerad!</i>” he repeated, and
at the same time both of his hands went high into
the air.</p>

<p>“Quiet!” ordered Dave in German, and the
fellow understood and kept still. Then our hero
made the man turn around in the hole and, watching
him carefully, deprived the fellow of his
ammunition.</p>

<p>With the gun and the bayonet ready for use,
our hero felt somewhat relieved. If attacked, he
would now have a chance to defend himself.</p>

<p>With the dying out of the star shells the darkness
again settled over that vicinity. Dave
ordered the man to move out of the shell-hole, and
then told him to march on, keeping his hands up
as before. The fellow walked with a slight limp,
showing that he had either been wounded or had
hurt himself.</p>

<p>Knowing that the body of Germans he had seen
must still be in the wood, Dave gave that vicinity
a wide berth, moving somewhat to the southward.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
This presently brought him to another small strip
of wood.</p>

<p>And then the unexpected happened.</p>

<p>As if by magic fully a dozen Germans leaped
up from where they had been concealed. All
pointed their guns at him, but not a shot was fired,
for, as he had surmised, several detachments were
out in an endeavor to obtain prisoners from whom
they expected to elicit much-needed information.</p>

<p>The young lieutenant’s fighting blood was up.
He had no desire to go back to a German prison,
and the instant the enemy showed themselves, he
began to blaze away with his rifle, running at top
speed for the shelter of the wood as he did so.
He had the satisfaction of seeing one of the Germans
go down, and a second quickly followed.
Then came the discharge of several of the enemy’s
firearms, and Dave felt a hot flash of pain through
his right side.</p>

<p>“I’m shot! They’ve got me!” was the thought
that flashed through his mind, and yet he did not
stop, but continued to run and to use his gun.
After him, but at a distance, came the Germans,
determined to make him a prisoner or shoot him
down.</p>

<p>“Stop!” came the sudden cry from in front of
our hero, and he saw several soldiers rise up from
the brushwood, all leveling their rifles at him.
“Hands up!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>“Are you Americans?” questioned Dave
quickly, for the darkness was too intense for him
to distinguish what they were.</p>

<p>“You bet!” was the laconic response. “Who
are you?”</p>

<p>Dave told them, advancing as he did so. And
then he added quickly: “There are about a
dozen or fifteen German soldiers after me—some
kind of raiding party.”</p>

<p>“That’s the party we are after,” was the quick
reply, from a captain who was commanding the
Americans. “Boys, are you ready to round them
up?”</p>

<p>“We sure are!” was the ready response.</p>

<p>“Can you show us just where those fellows
are?” questioned the captain of Dave.</p>

<p>“I can! They were after me just a minute
ago. They must be lying low in yonder brushwood.
If you had a few hand-grenades you could
get every one of them.”</p>

<p>“We’d rather surround them and take them as
prisoners,” returned the captain. “I think I’ve
got just the men here to do it.”</p>

<p>He had about thirty-five men with him, all of
whom had volunteered for the night expedition.
He quickly explained what was wanted, and then
the men spread out, one party going to the right
and the other to the left of where the Germans
had last been seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>“Can’t I go along, Captain?” questioned Dave
eagerly. “I had one prisoner a few minutes ago,
but those fellows stole him away from me.”</p>

<p>“Of course you can go if you want to, Lieutenant,”
was the captain’s reply. “I reckon you
are spoiling for a fight just as we are,” he continued.
He was a Southern military man and
well known for his daring.</p>

<p>The Americans advanced quickly but with
caution, and before they knew it the Germans
found themselves cut off in the rear. They put up
a short and stiff fight, in which one of their men
was killed and three were wounded, and then they
surrendered.</p>

<p>In this contest Dave distinguished himself by
bringing down one of the enemy and also in recapturing
the German who had a little while before
gotten away from him.</p>

<p>All of the prisoners were rounded up, disarmed,
and made to march toward the American lines.
While this was being done Dave staggered over to
the side of the American captain.</p>

<p>“I’ve been wounded in the side, Captain,” he
said. “I don’t believe it’s very serious, but at
the same time I am feeling rather weak. I have
important maps and documents with me which I
stole from the German headquarters. I wish to
get these to our headquarters just as quickly as
possible. Will you help me to do it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“I certainly will, Lieutenant,” was the ready
response. “Do you want me to send some of the
men to headquarters with the documents or do you
want to go yourself? If you would rather go
yourself, I’ll send a couple of men to assist you.”</p>

<p>“I think I’d rather go myself,” answered Dave,
with a faint grin. “But I’ll have to fix up my
wound first.”</p>

<p>With a first-aid kit the slight wound in Dave’s
side was taken care of temporarily, and then, in
company with two of the soldiers, the young lieutenant
tramped off in the direction of the American
field headquarters. He had previously
learned that the engineering unit to which he was
attached was located several miles away.</p>

<p>Fortunately the distance to headquarters was
not great, and the young lieutenant and those with
him arrived there at midnight. Dave was about
all in, yet he managed to make his report and deliver
the maps and documents he had taken from
the German headquarters.</p>

<p>“This is certainly fine work, Lieutenant Porter,”
said one of the commanding officers, who
was in charge. “Very fine work indeed! These
maps and documents may prove of great importance.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, sir. That is why I took them,”
answered the young lieutenant in an unsteady voice.
Then, of a sudden, all seemed to grow black before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
his eyes and he staggered and would have
fallen had not some of those around supported
him.</p>

<p>“This strain has been too much for you, Lieutenant,”
said another of the officers kindly. “I
think we had better turn you over to one of our
doctors immediately.” And this was done, and
Dave was given the best of medical attention.
Then he was fed and put to bed, and in a short
while was in sound slumber. This was in one of
the dugouts, where he was safe from the bombardment,
which still continued.</p>

<p>Early on the following morning another advance
was made by the Americans. This was due
in part to the maps and documents which Dave
had brought in and which proved the weakness
of the Germans at one point on the line. This
point was carried a few hours later by our troops;
and then followed a general advance which continued
almost uninterruptedly for three days.</p>

<p>“We’ve got ’em on the run!” was the cry of the
Americans, and it proved true. The Germans
were practically beaten, although they were still
holding out as well as they possibly could, hoping
in the meantime that their rulers might make some
satisfactory terms with those who opposed them.</p>

<p>It was a rather pale and weak Lieutenant Porter
who entered the camp of the engineers just as the
fierce three days’ fighting had come to an end.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
He had already sent in word over a field telephone
that he was alive and was coming, so that his
chums were not as much surprised as they would
otherwise have been. Yet they hailed his advent
with great joy.</p>

<p>“It’s the best news yet, Dave!” cried Roger,
grabbing him around the waist. “The very best
yet!”</p>

<p>“You can’t imagine how bad we felt when we
thought the Germans had killed you,” put in Phil.</p>

<p>“We went on all sorts of hunts for you,” added
Ben. “But, of course, we didn’t find you, and we
couldn’t imagine what had become of you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t know yet how I happened
to be missing,” said our hero. “It’s a long
story, but I’ll tell it to you just as soon as I’ve
rested.”</p>

<p>“We know something of the truth,” answered
Roger, and a stern look crossed his face. “We
know who assaulted you and rolled you down into
the abandoned mine.”</p>

<p>“You do!” exclaimed Dave, in surprise.
“That’s more than I know! Who did it?”</p>

<p>“Max Gebauer and Nat Poole.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX<br>

<small>CAPTAIN DAVID PORTER—CONCLUSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Gebauer</span> and Poole! You don’t mean it!”
exclaimed the young lieutenant.</p>

<p>“But I do mean it,” answered the senator’s son.
“They are the ones who attacked you and rolled
you down one of the shafts of the mines. It’s a
great wonder you weren’t killed.”</p>

<p>“But how did you learn of this, Roger?”</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty long story, Dave; and as you look
rather weak, perhaps you had better sit down
while I tell it.”</p>

<p>Roger and the others led the way to where our
hero could be made comfortable, and there, while
he was treated to some refreshments, they gave
him many of the particulars of what had occurred
during his absence.</p>

<p>“I guess I had better tell you about Max Gebauer
first,” said the senator’s son. “During one
of the advances of our army, he acted in a most
disgraceful manner, urging a part of his company
to retreat. They saw no good reason for doing
it, and a sergeant led them in the advance. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
this Gebauer was accused of cowardice in the face
of the enemy.”</p>

<p>“Phew! that’s rather a serious charge.”</p>

<p>“But that isn’t the worst of it!” broke in
Phil. “Do you remember the German prisoner
who saw Gebauer and talked to him—the fellow
you afterwards interviewed?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Well, it seems Gebauer visited that fellow
while he was at a prisoners’ camp, and the two got
into a regular row. This, of course, was before
Gebauer showed his so-called cowardice.</p>

<p>“Well, the secret service men made an investigation
and discovered that Gebauer and this
prisoner had once been in a questionable business
deal in Germany. Gebauer was wanted there for
swindling several people, and this chap had been
bought off to keep silent, but had never received
a large part of the money promised to him by Gebauer.
Then the American authorities dipped
deeper into the matter, and I understand they have
now come to the conclusion that Gebauer’s cowardice
was largely put on, and that he was in a plan
with some German sympathizers to play into the
enemy’s hands. As a consequence Lieutenant
Max Gebauer, pro-German, is now languishing in
a military prison.”</p>

<p>“And you can bet he isn’t a lieutenant any
more!” declared Ben.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>“Well, that explains some things, but it doesn’t
explain how you learned that he and Nat Poole
attacked me,” said Dave. “Of course, I imagined
it might be them, but I wasn’t sure. I really
didn’t think they would go so far.”</p>

<p>“Nat says he was dragged into it. But, of
course, that may be all talk. Nat always did like
to squirm out of a tight place,” went on Roger.</p>

<p>He then related how the money lender’s son
had been in the great fight and almost lost his life.
His injuries had necessitated his being sent to the
hospital, and there, while in a fever, he had continually
spoken about Dave and of the attack on
the young lieutenant.</p>

<p>“He went on so awfully that the nurse notified
one of the doctors, and he in turn called in an army
officer. In his rational moments Nat was closely
questioned, and in the end he broke down and
made a complete confession.</p>

<p>“He said that he wanted to get square with
you for the way he had been treated, but he had
not imagined that Gebauer would go so far. He
had struck you once, but it was only a light blow,
and Gebauer had given you the crack that almost
finished you. And he insisted that it was Gebauer
who rolled you into the opening of the mine.
He said he was scared at this, and remonstrated,
but Gebauer would not listen to him. He even
made a search for your body, but, of course, did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
not find it. He said he was terribly worried, and
I shouldn’t wonder but what that was so.”</p>

<p>“It was a dastardly thing to do!” declared
Dave. “And I am glad that both Gebauer and
Nat have been caught. I guess each of them will
get what is coming to him without my making any
charge against them.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that, Dave. Perhaps
you’ll have to see headquarters on that point,”
answered Roger.</p>

<p>Of course all the others were glad to see our
hero. Captain Obray came up to shake hands,
and so did Frank Andrews and a number of the
other fighting engineers. All had their stories to
tell, and all praised Dave greatly for what he had
accomplished at the German headquarters and
during the fight when he was trying to get back
to the American lines.</p>

<p>“The authorities won’t forget you for what you
have done,” said Captain Obray. “It was simply
great, and I congratulate you with all my heart.”
The captain himself had done some wonderful
work during the last great advance by the Americans,
leading a wire-cutting detachment in person
over a stretch of territory where the bullets and
shrapnel were flying freely. For this the captain
received special mention and was, later on, advanced
to the position of major of engineers.</p>

<p>Dave, of course, had been reported as missing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
but now his name was placed back on the roll.
He lost no time in sending long letters to the folks
at home, acquainting them with what had taken
place.</p>

<p>Awaiting him was a bunch of letters from his
father and his sister, as well as from Jessie, and
these, my readers may rest assured, he read with
great eagerness.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear folks at home!” he murmured to
himself, after he had read one of Jessie’s letters a
second time. “How glad I am that this war is
almost over. I’ll be mighty glad to get back to
them once more!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And now let us pass over a period of some
months and then bring this tale of Dave Porter’s
war activities to an end.</p>

<p>As our hero had remarked, the war was almost
over. Deserted by her allies and beaten back on
the fields of battle, Germany could hold out no
longer, and so begged for an armistice, which,
when granted, was so severe in its terms that its
acceptance was equal to Germany’s complete surrender.
She gave up her entire navy, the second
largest in the world, abandoned all the territory
she had invaded, and in addition allowed the
United States and the Allies to occupy a large
portion of her own country along the Rhine.</p>

<p>“It’s a complete collapse,” was the way Dave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
expressed himself when this had taken place; and
the young lieutenant was right. The signing of
the armistice was followed some time later by the
opening of the real peace negotiations.</p>

<p>And while all these things were taking place
something occurred to make our hero’s heart
bound with pleasure. He was cited for special
bravery in obtaining the maps and the documents
from the German field headquarters, and also for
his daring in the fight which had followed during
his endeavor to get back to the American lines.
For these deeds he was awarded the Distinguished
Service Cross, and a little later obtained a commission
as a full-fledged captain of engineers.</p>

<p>“Dave, I congratulate you!” cried Roger,
when he heard this news.</p>

<p>“And so do I,” added Phil. “And you deserve
it, Dave, indeed you do!”</p>

<p>It may be added here that our hero was not the
only one to obtain promotion. For their heroic
work in road building and in cutting wire entanglements
under heavy fire, both Roger and Phil were
given medals and made lieutenants, while Ben became
a sergeant and Shadow and Buster corporals.</p>

<p>“And now I’ve got to congratulate you fellows,”
said Dave to Roger, Phil, and the others.
“I tell you, old Oak Hall can be proud of this
bunch!”</p>

<p>“That’s what!” answered Phil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>“What a shame Nat Poole had to act the way
he did,” said Ben. “He’s the one bad egg in the
basket.”</p>

<p>It may be added here that later on, when he
had recovered from his illness, Nat Poole was dishonorably
discharged from the army, and went
back home a sadder if not a wiser young man.
Max Gebauer was tried for his various misdeeds,
and found guilty and sentenced to a long term in
prison.</p>

<p>“I hope Nat has learned his lesson and turns
over a new leaf after this,” remarked Dave, on
hearing this news. “In spite of what he has done
against me, I bear him no ill will.” Later still he
heard that Nat had obtained a position as a traveling
salesman for a hardware house and was doing
his best to make good in that capacity.</p>

<p>It was a great day for the young engineers when
they set sail for home. Other engineering units
had come to France and were at the front, and it
was felt that those who had gone through so
many thrilling experiences had done all that could
be asked of them.</p>

<p>“Home, sweet home, for me!” sang out Phil.
“I never did think America could mean so much
to me!”</p>

<p>“It’s the best of all the places in which to live,”
answered Dave. “The very best!”</p>

<p>The home-coming was one long to be remembered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
Jessie was at the depot to greet Dave, and
as soon as he alighted from the train she fairly
rushed into his arms.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope you never have to go to another
war, Dave—never!” she cried, as he held her
close.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m hoping, Jessie, that this war will
prove to be the last one,” he answered.</p>

<p>Roger, as well as Ben, had come on to Crumville
with Dave, and the greeting the senator’s son received
from Laura was equally cordial, while Ben
was not forgotten by his folks and the others.</p>

<p>Dave kissed his sister several times and shook
hands with his father and his Uncle Dunston, and
all finally got into the two Wadsworth automobiles
and drove to the mansion.</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Wadsworth awaited them, and
kissed Dave over and over again, and Mr. Wadsworth
shook hands heartily. And there, too, was
old Caspar Potts, his eyes full of a kindly sympathy
which could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>“My Davy! My Davy!” he murmured over
and over again. “I knew you would do it! Oh,
Davy, how proud I am of you!”</p>

<p>“And just to think—it’s Captain David Porter
now!” cried Uncle Dunston. “Some pumpkins
for this family, I do declare!”</p>

<p>“And Lieutenant Morr—don’t forget that!”
added Laura, her face beaming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>“And it’s Lieutenant Lawrence, too,” said
Roger.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he come along?” questioned Mr.
Porter.</p>

<p>“Oh, he had a date with Belle Endicott. She
and her folks came all the way from Montana to
New York City to greet him.”</p>

<p>That night there was a great celebration at the
Wadsworth mansion, many friends dropping in to
greet Dave and Roger and congratulate them on
their promotions. Of course, the young captain
and the young lieutenant were in their new uniforms
and Dave even wore a new wrist-watch his
father gave him to replace the one lost in France,
and if Jessie and Laura felt very proud of their
fiancés, who can blame them?</p>

<p>The young engineers had to tell the particulars
of many of the things which had happened to them
during the war and had even to show some of the
scars which had been inflicted.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dave, I am so very thankful that you
didn’t come back minus an arm or a leg!” cried
Jessie. “I’m so very, very thankful! After this
whenever I meet a soldier who has been crippled
I shall treat him with the greatest consideration,
for now I understand a little of what he must have
endured.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jessie, they will deserve all the consideration
you can give them,” the young captain answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
gravely. “They are the real heroes—the
fellows who will have to endure long after the
shouting and the excitement have died out.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Some time later there was another gala affair at
the Wadsworth mansion. This was the occasion
of a double wedding, when the beautiful Jessie
Wadsworth became the bride of Captain David
Porter and the bewitching Laura Porter paired off
with Lieutenant Roger Morr.</p>

<p>At this double wedding Lieutenant Philip Lawrence
was the best man for Dave, and Sergeant
Benjamin Basswood was the best man for Roger.
Among the bridesmaids was Belle Endicott, who
had come all the way from her home in the West
to be present.</p>

<p>There was also present a large contingent from
Oak Hall, including Doctor Clay, the master, and
Andrew Dale, his head assistant. Of course
Buster Beggs and Shadow Hamilton were on hand,
as were also Luke Watson, Sam Day, Bertram
Vane, and some others of the old crowd.</p>

<p>The gifts to the brides were both numerous and
costly, and both couples received the heartiest congratulations
of all present.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to do likewise pretty soon, Belle,”
whispered Phil to the girl from Montana, and at
this she blushed and smiled. It was not long after
that when this couple was also married, a host of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
their friends, including Dave and Roger and their
wives, being present.</p>

<p>Dave and Jessie had already decided on where
they were going to live. Mr. Porter had purchased
for them a beautiful house and grounds not
far from the Wadsworth mansion, and here they
set up housekeeping and were very happy.</p>

<p>Laura and Roger went to the old Morr homestead
to live, the senator and his wife at that time
spending practically all their time in Washington.</p>

<p>Phil and Belle went to reside in Philadelphia,
where the young shipping master had most of his
interests.</p>

<p>For Dave and Jessie and all their friends the
future looked very rosy; and here we will leave
them and say good-bye.</p>
